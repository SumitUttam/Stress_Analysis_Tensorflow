Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).\n",

Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice.

She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country.

We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.\n",

            "My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of \"fights\" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in \"trouble\" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.\n",
            "\n",
            "Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was \"living expenses\" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.\n",
            "\n",
            "After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \\[no offense to overweight people\\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).\n",
            "\n",
            "Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were \"problems with immigration\" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).\n",
            "\n",
            "I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally \"wrong\" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was \"patrolling\" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was \"popular\") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as \"help\"; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.\n",

            "That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too \"tired\" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was \"fine\" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.\n",

            "As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \\~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.\n",

Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me.\n",

Does it ever occur to you that when I’m depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation, it’s because nothing sparks joy in me anymore? I no longer have a) hobbies anymore or; b) no energy to carry out those hobbies. Telling me to go for a walk is unrealistic when I’m afraid to even get out of bed in the first place and leave my room because if I do, I’m afraid of what I’m capable of doing to myself and afraid of acting on my intrusive thoughts. Why am I afraid? I don’t fear death in itself but I fear dying. The pain involved in dying. The agony. The fear of it not working. Telling me to “oh eat your favourite food”, doesn’t fucking help. I have no appetite and I unintentionally starve myself. When I try to eat the smallest amount, I can’t help but almost vomit. Time doesn’t heal all and I hate being told that it does. Shit has gotten worse over time and I’m sick of people saying you have to have patience. Says fucking who? I don’t have to do shit and even then I did for the sake of other people. Not everything is a happy ending and people need to just accept that fucking fact. We aren’t always going to get closure. Some people just are played the unfortunate cards in life and that’s how it just fucking is. Whether you admit it or not, not everybody is going to fall to some happy ending fairytale bullshit and that’s the harsh truth of reality. Don’t tell me to go outside and enjoy nature. Looking at a bunch of leaves won’t magically make me not want to kill myself and won’t cure fucking anything. I need proper help but there’s nothing out there aside from “discover your interests”. Who the fuck cares. That’s just another way of distracting yourself from the problem and running away from it, not actively sorting it out because nothing can fix it. Irreversible damage and people act like going for a run or having a warm bath will fucking change anything. Cliche as fuck. I hate this life. I wish I was dead. Nobody gives a shit until then anyway, nobody takes anyone seriously until you’re dead and even then, they forget about you within a while anyway and don’t tell me that isn’t true. They do. Because it’s human nature to be able to grieve and move on, it’s within our innate tendencies to do so. Fuck this “life”. Living and exisiting are two very different things. Living means to feel alive and I’m purely existing. “Alive” in the sense that I’m breathing but I’m dead inside. Please let me fucking go.\n",

Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend.

For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?\n",

            "If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us \"Your'e not alone, we understand\", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. \n",

It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say \"You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to.\" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical \"no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you\" bullshit approach.\n",

            "That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. \n",

            "Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated \"helper\" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say \"Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed.\" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.\n",

Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. \n",

You can't go up to a suicidal person and say \"hey, don't kill yourself.\" It'd be so much better if you could say \"hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you. I probably won't miss you either. But I do hope you make it out of this sometime.\"\n",

I know that people will question my actions. People will wish I pushed harder and not have done this. I have been in despair for so many years. Suffering silently and trying my hardest to get better; to have peace. I unfortunately couldn’t bear the weight of my mental illness. It changed me, ripped away every fiber of my being. Left me broken and unrecognizable. I lost everything I love to my sickness. I look in the mirror daily and have no idea who I am. All I see is a deeply broken man. I ask that you keep the memories of me for who I was. The unbroken A.. The comforter, the loving person, the selfless A., the man who breaks bread with strangers in need, the one full of compassion and unconditional love. Please don’t remember me for the monster I have become. The angry man, having no patience or control, selfish and hurtful towards those I love; bipolar. I cannot bear that reality. Knowing that I am not me anymore. No matter how hard I try, the A. I once was is dead. I miss his softness, his love, his intellect, his ability to understand and protect others. All I am left with is a shell. I look like A.. But I assure you, he is completely dead inside. Nothing is left of him. No matter how hard I try, I cannot revive him. He is gone, and I carry the weight of who I once was. No more am I actually alive, my fire is gone, my will to live completely destroyed. I am just a shell now. I have unbearable headaches daily. I can’t speak with articulate words anymore. My emotions are numb now. I don’t feel anything. My mind whispers daily that relief will come only when I give up.  That my peace will come when I quit. I have never been a quitter, I have always been a fighter. But for the first time in my life, I face an enemy whom I cannot defeat. My mind is my enemy now instead of my best friend, as it used to be. I know that people will think I am selfish. I ask you to please not carry this pain. It’s unbearable and not worthy to carry. I wish this cup was not mine to drink from, but the poison has come to me anyways. I know that nobody will get to ask me why? Or find the closure they seek. Please find closure in this fact. I am sick, if I wasn’t sick I wouldn’t have taken my life. I couldn’t bear this weight anymore. It has destroyed and taken from me everything that I am. My ability to think, my emotions to feel, my fire, my life. It has taken everything that I was. Nothing is left of me that is me. I wish I could kill what’s wrong with me and still live. But the reality is that I cannot. Please forgive me and allow me the dignity to be remembered for who I was, not what I became. It gives me great shame to know what I am now. To know that my smile is nothing but a mask, my eyes an ocean of despair. I have tried the medications, the therapy, held on to hope. But nothing will fix this. Just as cancer takes over a man and steals his life. So it is with my severe mental illness. This is a cancer, invisible, in the mind. Nothing can cured this. Nothing could have prevented this. I lived a good life. I traveled and felt the world beneath my feet, met good people everywhere I went, and it was beautiful. My life was not lived in vain. I was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. They showed me how to live again. I will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. My life would not have had joy or love without my family. I wish this illness never happened. I have overcome so much in life, but I couldn’t overcome this.  \n",

But, even thought we live together I hardly get to see her because she works days and I work graveyard, so when I get home she has to leave. I see here a total of maybe 10 hours a work week.

I go into such deep depressions that I feel like my heart could stop at any moment (wouldn’t be opposed to it anyway). I’m scared to die, but I’m not scared of being dead. The only time I’m happy without her is if I smoke and that last a couple hours tops. I don’t know why I’m so sad. Plenty of people have it way worse then me and somehow they are happy without effort. I have it made, good job, love of my life, a place to lay me head at the end of the night. Sadness overwhelms me almost daily, I’ve tried everything I can. I wake up ever morning and wish I hadn’t. Living seems like an endless battle that I can’t win.  Everyone thinks I’m joking when I tell them I want to die, but honestly that’s the most truthful thing to ever leave my mouth.

Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most. I'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train. I don't know why I am posting this, but I just needed to get this off my chest before I do it. Thank you for your time and I genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine.\n",

What's the point in continuing on if I'm just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen? I'll never marry, because I'll never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings, my depression, my complete lack of emotional control. I'm already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I'll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I'll keep pushing people away because I'm so afraid they'll hurt me. What's the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they'll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice. But all anyone has ever done is pull a curtain over it and tell me not to look. But it's there, it's always there and it always will be.

I had to use a prison toilet - in socks. She said I think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. That’s it. Yesterday I got a bill in the mail for $3,711. For that one night where they did nothing. Nothing. I had to reschedule my appointments this month because I just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. I have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? After insurance? For locking me in a room so I could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. How pathetic do I feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. A lot of my unnecessary stress is money. Why is it so expensive to get help? Why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? Why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? It’s so fucking expensive. Getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live.

            "Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.\n",

I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as \"if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens\". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.\n",

It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again.

With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument \"your family and friends will be sad\". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever.\n",

Nothing could be more wrong.  \"It gets better\" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a \"hopeful\" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.  \n",

            "For most of my life I've just been blissfully unaware. Classic stupid person attitude that I was special and unique, with no evidence to back it up. Recently, my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting, and I can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot. Just all around dumb. It makes me want to kill myself when I consider that this is fundamentally who I am at my core. Here are some examples of how I know I am a deeply stupid person:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. I smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college. I never gave a shit about my major, but just sort of blindly accepted that I was going to college now. I graduated, after having spent most of my energy partying, with a degree that left me $75,000 in debt. I got a job in my major, but was laid off after three years. During my time at my job, I don't feel like I advanced at all, because I was incurious, lazy, and overall unengaged. I showed up half an hour late almost every day. I was a graphic designer, but didn't save any work for a portfolio, so I have nothing to show for it. I've been unemployed for almost a year. I can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school, when I didn't have a care in the world. This is also a reflection of my non-existent critical thinking skills. If I had any foresight or insight into problem solving, I would have planned SOMETHING for myself throughout the years. Instead, I coasted through life as if I had no future, with no plan, no thought, and no fucking brains.\n",
            "2. I can never remember anything. I can't remember names or events, in movies or in real life. Because of this I don't really have any opinions. I forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens. A friend of mine recently watched The Fellowship of the Ring. He was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie, but it was all lost on me. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and I would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch, but I literally couldn't remember anything from it. It's like this with everything. I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I'm a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I've never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I'm too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.\n",
            "3. I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don't take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I'd rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I'm so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can't keep things clear in my head. It's always a jumbled mess. There's no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says \"VACANT.\" Even if I tried to learn something, I'd just forget it anyway. I'm going to lose all my friends because I'm so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.\n",
            "4. I can't keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we're all in the same room together, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don't say anything. I have nothing to say. It's like this with everyone. I can't keep up. I'm slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I'm stupid and empty.\n",
            "5. I lack emotional intelligence. I don't know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don't know how to tell people what they need to hear when they're feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I'm an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There's something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend's family member died recently, I didn't know what to say to comfort them. I said \"I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love.\" It's not enough. There's something missing. I'm so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they're upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I'm going to lose all my friends because I don't know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.\n",
            "\n",
            "These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn't informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I've diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I've finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I'm simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I'll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I'll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren't too many connections being made up there. I don't know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I'm smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I've said is true. I just simply can't keep up with anything. I can't keep anything straight. I can't communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I've always been. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm so ashamed.\n",

My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time.

Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response.

I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break.

I forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  I feel like I am just a disappointment and I might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  I have already pretty much decided that if I get prison time then I will do it but I fear I wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  I felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation I feared the most in life.

Staff saw me and waved for my attention but I ignored them and I started to walk onto the tracks.

The train I aimed for stopped and started to flash the lights on the front of the train, then I realised the police were here and they were in the tracks with me but I was quite far out.

So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.\n",

She said it would be better if we leave our feelings behind. I asked if she is gonna call me ever again , she said yes. But I don't really know if that's true. 2 nights ago she explained that she can't live a day without my voice, but now... She told me there is no one out there like me, but is that true? I asked if she wants to leave all that what we have behind and she said she isn't really sure. She has a rough week coming and may be not able to call me even if she wanted to. She said we will decide if we are going to break up in a week, but it feels like we already did. Right now I'm lying my bed crying over her. Holding my phone , taking it everywhere so I won't miss her call if she would call me and the only thought in my mind is: \" please don't leave me , I was so happy with you , I don't want you to be gone\" Will it be the same again sometime , is she gonna come back to me , is this the end ? \n",

We spent our last week together walking and talking. Going to old places we used to eat. Laying in bed, watching movies we never saw but said we would, I looked over to her and told her I was afraid to lose her. She smiled and make a funny comment.\n",

I took her to the hospital and After a while of some needed rest she woke up and asked to see me. She told me she loved me and thanked me for spending my life with her and hers with me. She told me not to be afraid that no matter what she would always be with me. Right next to me at work dealing with those shitty customers I always come home and talk about at dinner. That she would be right next to me when I was laying in bed watching my favorite movies (Her, Spike Jonze) I started to tear up I knew in my head I was so afraid to lose my wife. My only friend. My only family. I looked into her eyes for the last time and just remembered our last week together. I remembered our small apartment. I remembered the smell of her side of the bed. Her beautiful perfume. In that moment I wasn't afraid anymore. I loved it because I saw my life in her eyes before and after this. Because she would always be with me.\n",

They originally divorced when I was 3, but got back together in late 2016/early 2017, then seperated in January. She fell down the stairs, making a huge banging noise I’ll never forget. I was in my room at the time, on my phone, minding my own business. The bang was loud and startling. I ran out of my room to see what happened, silently praying that all that happened was she dropped a bowl or something. I then saw her naked in a towel at the bottom of the stairs unconscious. I’d never been so terrified. I quickly got my phone, and at first, I didn’t notice the blood pouring out of her head, and my first instinct was to call my brother. He didn’t pick up. I called my dad. He didn’t pick up. Tried my brother again. He didn’t pick up. When I noticed the blood, I nearly screamed. I called 000, trembling, scared, mortified at what I was seeing.

The necklace that was given to her by her first husband and my brother and sister’s dad, before he disappeared 16 years ago. I tied the necklace around my wrist.

Veronica got into anime and video games because of Mia and I. Veronica Skyped me, and we talked for half an hour.

The bills went paid, and any forms for school would be signed and ready to take in the morning from off the dining table. The other way I knew that she was still around was I could hear her showering when getting home from work. It would be around 3AM usually. I don't know why, but I always woke up when she got home after bar-tending. I would listen to her come into the house and up the stairs. She always head to her room to grab clothes, then would shower. I'd wait until I could hear the bathroom door close, then I'd sneak out of bed.

I would close my eyes and listen to the water, to the sounds of the shampoo and conditioner bottles being opened and closed. There was loose pieces of string from the carpet where I would pull at it. It wasn't done well, the carpet, it was badly cut where it met the metal door divider. If I felt daring I would stick my little hand under the door, and run my fingers over the cold tiles.\n",

I remember playing freeze tag that day. The end of the day came quickly, and my sister walked us back home. My mother would have already come home from the daycare and left to the bar. My sister was in charge of dinner, and we always seemed to have canned food that was microwaved. She wasn't allowed to use the stove yet.

I laid in bed, eager to fulfill my routine. It felt like it was something I *had* to do. My mom was slower to the shower this night. She stayed downstairs longer than normal, to this day I don't really know what she had been doing. When she did finally come up the stairs I could hear her walk a bit into the hallway and stop. It seemed like she was going to come down into the hallway where our rooms were, but after a moment she went straight to the bathroom instead. Usually she went to her room first to grab clothes. I was hesitant to step out, because surely she forgot and would come out to grab some, right? I waited a little bit, and the shower started. I waited some more. I think I stood at my door with my hand on the handle for around 10 minutes before I got the courage to move.\n",

I didn't really understand what I was looking at, I felt like maybe I had been caught and she was waiting for me. I thought I would be in trouble. But she didn't move. The shower was on, and she was just standing there. Not really standing either. Her right foot was planted on the floor like normal, but her left was out and leaning weirdly to the left.

I didn't get a response, so I knocked again and this time I actually spoke, I said \"Hey Mum, I have to pee.\", hoping that maybe she would tell me to go downstairs to the other bathroom, or open the door. Neither happened. I stood up now and tried to open the door, but it was locked. I knew how to unlock this type of door however. It was one of the handles that you could unlock with a coin, or anything thin enough that could fit. I figured out how to do it with my thumb nail.\n",

She was held up by a cord that was tied tight to the shelving unit. It was around her neck, and she was so purple. Like those men on cartoons when they got really angry. But she wasn't angry, she was dead. And I knew this. I knew it then, but I didn't want to believe it. After opening the door and finding her, I walked over to the shower and turned it off. I kept thinking that she would be mad with the waste of water. She worked so hard for her money, I didn't want the bills to be too much. I couldn't stop staring at her though. I wanted to get her down, I didn't want to see the cord pulling at her skin anymore. Her arms were limp, and I can't remember the last time I'd hugged her. I didn't know what else to do, so I left the bathroom and went to my sisters room. I remember feeling like a robot, like it wasn't real. I woke her up and told her \"*Mom's in the bathroom*\" and that's all I could get out. My sister was confused, and rightly so. I had to repeat myself \"*Moms in the bathroom Chris\".* She could probably tell something was wrong because she told me to just lay down, and I did. I laid in her bed, and watched her pad across her room into the hallway. I listened to her as she discovered mom, I listened to her cry out and say \"no no\". I listened to her run out of the bathroom and down the stairs. She ran to the kitchen where we had the house phone and called the police. It was quiet for a while, my sister stayed downstairs. She told me later, that she was afraid that if she came back upstairs that she'd see mom again.\n",

But in one day someone busted me, he gives access to church to those two who grief me before and then they destroyed my church, no items survived. I actually have a few footages where they were cheating and griefing. Actually, I showed it to admins. And guess what? I got permanently banned. They bought the admins. The main conflict is very stupid, to solve it I need to apologize for not letting them grief me and don't add them immediately to private.

My sister called and said that they were already in the parking lot so I needed to come meet them. When I finally did make my way through the crowed I saw the 5 people who showed up for me.

            "She’s fine during the day. She hides away all her emptiness and covers it with fake laughs and meaningless conversations. But when the night hits, and she’s finally all alone in a dark room with the moonlight streaming through her window, she falls apart. Her walls that she worked so hard to build, crumble to dust, and everything she keeps hidden bubbles to the surface. The voice in her head, chants relentlessly. You will never be enough. You are the reason everyone leaves. Who could ever love you? And on and on. Until she breaks, she can’t think, she can’t speak and she can’t breathe. She can’t feel anything so she reaches to unzip the bag hidden in the depths of the shadows and drags the blade across her skin, the silver glistening in the moonlight, the blood slipping down her arms mixing with her fallen tears. And she can feel again, she can breathe again. So she returns the blade, wipes her tear-stained face and blood-soaked arms, silently slipping under the covers to fall into a dreamless sleep. She wakes in the morning like nothing happened like she didn’t break apart like a china doll, because her walls are up again. Built with steel and barbed wire wrapped in a fake, bubbly, persona. And her wall will stand high as the sun shines. She doesn't feel the cuts hidden beneath her clothes because she is numb, simply existing. She sits in a room filled with the people that are supposed to know everything about her and feels helpless, completely alone because she knows that they don’t know about the moon, the darkness, the tear-streaked pillowcases, and blood-soaked blades. They don’t see past the persona and they can’t see the mile-high wall. And she realizes how alone she truly is. But she won’t tell anyone. Because she knows what they’ll say. Attention seeker. Liar. Liar. Just be happy. Liar. Liar. Liar. Dramatic. Drama Queen. Whatever. Liar. Dramatic. Liar. Her chest starts to tighten with the all-too-familiar anxiety. Her heart feels like it's gonna beat out of her chest. And slowly she slips from reality, and her thoughts begin to consume her. Liar. Dramatic. Worthless. Fat. Ugly. Her thoughts rise like the ocean as she starts to drown. She struggles and struggles to not let the water in, to not let the words in, but eventually, she becomes too tired to fight to the surface. Her hope begins to fade and she gives in to the raging waters. She lets words sink in. Pathetic. Worthless. Fat. Liar. Dramatic. And she starts to believe them because when that's all you’re told you inevitably start to believe them. Eventually, the thoughts calm into a quiet murmur and she’s able to breathe again. But those thoughts stick with her, constantly reminding her. Watching her.  As her anxiety attack fades away, she realizes she’s still sitting there in that room filled to the brim with family and friends but no one noticed. No one noticed the girl in the corner who broke into a million pieces behind her walls that cage her in. So like I said. She’s fine during the day. You’ll never see her break because her heart is still healing for the last person she handed it to, blindly. She is still stitching the scars on her heart back together at night behind her walls full of hate and self-loathing. But you’ll never know this. She’ll live like this every day until her walls aren’t strong enough to hold her thoughts, her raging, horrible, thoughts. Until her anxiety attacks start to last days, and then weeks.  Until finally, she simply cannot handle it. So when you find her on the floor with pills and blood-soaked blades surrounding her with a sheet of paper folded up next to her heartbeat-less body, apologizing to her loved ones and thanking the life she tried to have, know that she fought like hell. Know that she tried her best to stay, but that sometimes broken people simply cannot be saved from their own minds.  \n",

Except this one was the WORST of my life and longest. I had to fake that my back was really sore and asked my friend if we could leave the game early. I then had a panic attack almost the entire drive (I was the passenger) home on the highway. I felt very \"trapped\" on the highway, so the attack did not subside.

It's been like living in your comfort zone 24/7 this entire time and I feel like it's making less and less room for me not to be anxious in life. Even when I'm outside it's me being anonymous shopping/walking etc. behind a mask. And like wtf... I feel like the situations and aspects of things that didn't cause anxiety in me are now doing that. I feel like I don't even know how to interact with people anymore because everything is a lot more anxiety-causing than ever. Fuck. I literally get anxiety/panic attacks when talking in class through computer and I never had anxiety at school like this... Also constantly seeing my relfection when we have cameras on is not helpful for my focus and for my body dismorphia. \n",

A lot of my friends are currently engaged, married, some have kids, and the rest with the exception of two are currently in serious relationships.

I had planned to move to a new state this summer whenever quarantine was ramping up but decided to stay because of school and family. I know I’m ultimately making decisions that will make my life better in the future but I can’t help but get discouraged when I see where other people I know are at in life right now.

But another reason is I recently found out my boss was really mad at me for being sick - in September I had a fever on and off for 3 weeks. I'd feel like I was better, I'd go into work, and all of a sudden I'd be so weak I couldn't stand, my fever would spike to 101ish out of nowhere, and I'd get sent home. I tested negative for covid but every health professional I spoke to during those 3 weeks told me to stay home, don't go to work, don't go anywhere because I probably had a false negative test. I was trying to do the right thing by staying home, but I literally can't afford to not work. I hate having to choose between doing what I know is right and going into work because I can't survive without income, and now I'm just terrified of getting sick from covid or anything else because I don't want my boss to be angry with me. With covid just getting worse, it's making me so anxious just to go into work. But I don't have a choice if I want to be able to pay my bills.\n",

            "I’m 23 years old and have never dealt with mental health in any real major way. I always have handled stress incredibly well and used it to propel me forward in life... until I couldn’t. I started working in the corporate world at the age of 16 after school. After graduating high school I went full time while concurrently being a full time student. My junior year I started my own business while still working and going to school. And then it happened. My last semester I was running on fumes. I was in 24 credit hours of the hardest classes my university offered, working through the nights to keep caught up on work and building a business in what little time I had. The 2 hour nights and the endless weeks caught up to me. \n",
            "\n",
            "After one particularly long Tuesday I found myself in the emergency room at 8 PM. As I sat explaining to the nurses that the reason my heart rate was resting at 140 was not the 4 energy drinks and coffee to get me through it must be a heart attack. I felt weak, as if I could faint at any moment, and my chest would tense up to the point I was afraid to move. Fear rushed through every vein and that flighty feeling was indescribable and unavoidable. After hours of panic they gave me a beta blocker, blamed the caffeine and sent me on my way. No mention of anxiety, the words panic attack never left the lips of a medical professional, I was flying blind. \n",
            "\n",
            "Fast forward three months. That chest pain was a regular occurrence. By this point I had figured out it was anxiety and promptly learned that a couple of drinks would handle the problem no questions ask. Spoiler alert: that is not the way to handle this problem. I’ve now graduated from college and was in the middle of moving myself and my girlfriend 600 miles to our new home. And it hit again. Back to the ER. This time they gave me a Xanax and told me I likely had a panic disorder. This second time through the emergency room was a turning point. I can’t do this alone. \n",
            "\n",
            "After two psychiatrists, 8 prescriptions and 3 months of hell, I’m finally turning the corner. For those of you interested what works for me is 15 mg of lexapro with a beta blocker and a benzo for flair ups. I’m finally able to work again without a 2 hour break in the fetal position whenever my brain decided it wanted to torture me. I just booked my first big trip since January and I have a great group of support for this journey. I always viewed anxiety as a weakness only perceived by those weaker and less capable, maybe that’s just how I was raised. But I am here as proof and a believer that anxiety is a weakness but it is not born from weakness. It’s real, it’s scary, and it’s debilitating. To anyone who might be reading this waiting to get help because they believe you can beat this alone, I hope you’re right but take it from me: there’s no shame in consulting a professional and it will likely be much healthier and efficient.

I’m noticing my heart beat at times with some racing. I have no underlying conditions I already got checked out by several doctors. How do I manage these symptoms so I don’t start freaking out and making myself anxious? I keep telling myself it’s just anxiety and it will go away but I also tend to blame my medications cause it’s just so strange to feel this without being anxious about anything. I’m on lexapro (7 weeks in) with trazadone (10 days in) at night. I took a low dose of Klonopin sporadically for a month at night to help with the acute symptoms and insomnia. I haven’t taken it in almost 2 weeks and don’t want to use it anymore so I’m wondering how to manage these symptoms. I was also freaking out thinking it’s benzo withdrawal but the doctors say it isn’t since I was only using it for a few weeks and not daily, and they’re probably right. It feels like my mind may be freaking out on a subconscious level causing these physical symptoms to manifest.\n",

He just couldn’t handle being in the relationship because he felt bad about not being able to be there for me as much as i was for him and was overwhelmed and too exhausted to see me or even text me back sometimes and he hated himself for it. It ended on very “to be continued” terms because we both still felt the same about each other, he just felt like he was dragging me down and I couldn’t stop him.  We talk a tiny bit every now and then, it’s mainly just me checking in on him to make sure he’s okay and to remind him I’m always here for him. He’s always incredibly appreciative of me reaching out to him, tells me he still thinks about me or that he hopes i’m taking care of myself, and has even tried to have some causal conversation with me a little bit. well recently we were in the middle of the best conversation we had had yet, (he finally asked me how i was doing and then asked a few questions to carry a conversation which was a big improvement and kinda shocking) and then he just never read my most recent message. (it’s on snapchat so you can’t see the message before you open it) and that’s just not like him. His last full week of classes was this week so I know that that must be really hard for him and he’s got a study week before finals this upcoming week so I assume school has just hit him like a train recently. It’s just out of character for him to not read my message at all- It’s been a full week since his last text tonight.\n",
            "\n",
            "I really believe he’s just not opening it because of anxiety and I’m assuming he’s having a really hard time right now, it’s just so hard to not question his motives sometimes even when I know that’s a real thing. Am I valid in assuming he’s just ignoring me right now because of his anxiety and stress? I’d really love to hear from other people who experience that kind of anxiety and can relate to avoiding texts/people like that. I’ve been so nervous going back and forth all week and it would make me feel less stupid for assuming the best in him to know other people experience that as well.\n",

In the past several months I’ve had the crisis line called on me twice, a hospital visit (I thought I wanted to admitted, but even the doctor thought that would do more harm than good) several therapist, and on more medications than I’ve ever been on- Lexapro, Buspar, Ativan, a blood pressure medication to help me sleep (it didn’t), hydroxyzine, and now Buspar again.

I’m no longer seeing her. My second therapist was nice, but my mom didn’t like her and I do not need my mom having beef with my therapist. And most recently, I was bullied by my psychiatrist until my mother stepped in to talk some sense into him. Actually, come to think of it, all of it has been terrible, but some of the events are just a tropical storm while the others are a hurricane. \n",

It meant more new medications, and the all too likely possibly of them not working or making me feel worse. Today was our emergency follow up (see my mother talking sense into him) and we have decided to try Buspar again. (He was going to put me on Remeron, but weight gain being a side effect meant it was a no go- somehow, me losing twenty pounds isn’t enough.)

It feels like I’ve lost sense of myself and everything around me- my home, my belongings, my interests, and my parents, which hurts the most.

Anyway this class is to see if you would like to be a counselor one day and is once a week. I didn't realize how hard it would be and how much you have to open up about yourself, if I knew it was this tough I don't think I would have done it. After doing 6 classes of it now, I don't think it's right for me but I need to finish it and I'm not even half way yet. The smaller group we branched out had two other people and we were talking about what counseling we had done and what we found difficult. I  said how I have always struggled with assertiveness and found it really difficult to assert myself in counselling sessions, that I would just let little things go instead of bringing them up.

This was the first time I started to open up and I felt very judged. I am aware she is going through a breakup and has a lot of problems with her relationship, but I'm not someone's punching bag.

A lot of my anxiety stems from fear of rejection, and a lot of that came from bad experiences when I was a kid. Basically I started to become self-aware and anxious and got bullied in middle school, and I made it my goal to not have any more rejection, and thus my “ideal” self was to be cool, funny, charismatic, not worried about what people think, etc. I was always scared of people who exuded these characteristics because I thought they were perfect and were judging me, and that I was nothing, basically just acting all the time.\n",

Working with Secular Buddhism, my new ideal was to become someone who is loving, understanding of others, non-judgmental, caring, compassionate, etc. Now when I consider what other people are thinking of me, I consider my new ideal, who I want to be and the type of person I want to look up to, and know that if some is judging me or looking down on me, they’re not exuding the type of person I choose to look up to and therefore their opinion means a lot less to me. I think of this quote from Thich Nhat Hanh often: “The more you understand, the more you love; the more you love, the more you understand.” There’s also the understanding that this ideal I made up in my head is just a concept, there is no way of being that’s better than any other; we’re just here to live.\n",

I'm a first year uni student and this year, due to the virus, all my lectures are online, which means I haven’t had the opportunity to meet anyone irl. This essentially means I'm doing lectures with a bunch of strangers. So anyway, I have this class where the professor takes 5 introductions from students every week. I had been avoiding this for weeks but today I thought id give it a shot because if I didn’t I was gonna keep getting anxious every lecture, so might as well get it out of the way. So, I started off shaky and then my voice kept getting higher (which is a side effect of my anxiety for some reason) and I started having a bit of trouble breathing properly…which is a given with almost any social interaction I have with people I barely know. Then the lecturer couldn’t hear me and she kept interrupting me which made me 10x more anxious and panicky than I would’ve been if this was face to face. After that I just started crying because I had thought about what I was going to say for weeks and it was all screwed up and everyone probably judged me. I genuinely hope no one saw me cry cause I tried to keep a straight face. I also feel like the lecturer doesn’t like me now. Honestly…corona and online learning has driven my social anxiety to be astronomically worse than it has ever been. I always have this random burst of confidence at the beginning of the day where I convince myself I'm like everyone else and I don’t have to feel like I'm lesser than anyone and I have no reason to be this anxious, but it always just goes up in flames the moment I actually take part in that social interaction. I also have no close friends atm so im all alone in this feeling. I really wish I had someone to encourage me.\n",

I even had the entire speech written out, but when it came time to present I self sabotaged myself into waking up late so I wouldn’t present. Then he gave me another chance to do it , and I still said I wasn’t ready and took the L lol. I calculated all my grades and saw I’ll only pass this class with a decent grade if I at least did well on  my next couple of speeches.  So, this time around our next speech assignment was due this week and I finished everything early , practiced a ton, and kept hoping I would finally grow some balls to present. So when it’s time for presentation he was going to make only a specific amount of people present today apparently without me included, and a few more would go next class , but at the end of it he asked if anyone still wanted to go. Everything in me was saying “NO NO NO”. Like I was so ready to present but anxiety kept trying to shut me up and not say anything. So I don’t say shit , then he asks again “last chance if anyone wants to go”. Felt like I was about to die but responded “yes i will  go”. And surprisingly I did pretty good . I did not stutter , did not miss much words , sounded confident (I thinkkk), people clapped at the end, and class ended, without me dying. :)\n",

            "I'm a sophomore in highschool taking all honors and AP classes. My time management has never been the best but I've managed to go through middle school with basically all A's. When sophomore year came along I didn't know how to handle all the work plus trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eventually the semester exams rolled in and that was when it got really bad. I wouldn't sleep or eat for days, always staying in my room trying to cram in order to get my grades up to all A's. Kept this up for a little more than a month and passed the exams, but I was so unimaginably burnt out and had basically no energy left at all. We had winter break for a couple weeks and I hoped that this'll help get my energy back for the next semester. It's been months now and I still don't feel right. The way I got my work done before is obviously not the healthiest but at least I got it done. Now I'm always thinking about the things i need to finish but never actually doing them. Worst part is I don't even procrastinate by doing the things I considered fun, probably would just lie down and watch youtube or look at memes for hours, not really enjoying it but at least I can take my mind off of work for a bit. It makes me a little sad to know that the things I'm learning at school would be things I'd be interested in, but the deadlines and assignments kinda turned potentially fun topics I could be passionate about, into just another load of stuff I need to do. I never go out and hang out with friends anymore, when I do it's because I force myself, so days just consist of me alternating between \"finishing work\" and just mindlessly looking through stuff on reddit.\n",

It really feels as if I'm wasting my entire life and that there's no way to pick myself back up again, because if I do take time to rest or figure things out for a couple days it's as if I'm be taking time away from schoolwork.

I’m scared to seek help because I don’t want to be seen as “just another attention seeking teenager,” and have already been dismissed by my mother when I shared my concerns.

Near the end of my trip, I realized just how unprepared I was, when I woke up and had $45 in my bank account. I still needed to drive home after my flight(in order to save about $300, I drove 6 hours to the cheapest airport around me. Cost of gas was about $70 round trip, for a total savings of about $225... it was worth it to me). Due to this and the fact I still had some bills to pay, I headed over to /r/Borrow and took out a loan(which I have since paid back).

That I'm not actually chemically depleted, but that there's a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that I go down. Or alternatively: that I'm just fed up with how little progress I'm making given the effort I put in. If this is true, it requires a whole different approach.

I didn't know this at the time, but he's running from the cops. He was a warrant out in our home state. He waits outside my house at the park next door till I wakeup to tell me that he's here. Someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool. He was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing. The cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me. I learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park. Those fucking racist neighbors, just because he's black doesn't mean he's homeless. I talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first, because I didn't want to identify myself, I was scared.

We get to a three way intersection, I take a right and pull into the second lane because I have to take an immediate left after. I pull over to next to the side walk and park. I start unbuckling and next thing I know there is a cop next to my window. He yells at me to roll down the window. The window doesn't work. I try to yell this through the door, he tells me to open the door. I comply, I am literally shaking. We have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud. I'm scared. He says he smells marijauna as soon as I open the door. Bullshit, he's lying. The bud is in a mason jar, and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it. He takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me. I know you have weed in there, so just let me know where it is and this will all be over. We don't mind calling the K-9 unites to search your car, and we probably won't stop them if they try to bite you in the ass. I tell them where everything is, I was scared.

I'm supposed to clean it every night. We usually have two servers on a busy night like this. I finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it's midnight. I have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush. I'm exhausted from covering another server's shift. I put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on, as it is broken. Skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasn't cleaned properly last night, and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAN YOU FUCKING READ???? I come in to see the damage and I see the note still on the ice cream machine. He say's he saw the note, but doesn't tell me anything more than that. He didn't tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note. He yells at me for not staying later than I did even though I already worked an hour and a half past my get off time, while working two fucking shifts.

I was never challenged and I was fine with that. I did advanced math in middle school and did fine. Last spring when online school started, everything fell apart, I skipped assignments, I didn't turn work in and when my parents got an email from my teachers, I was grounded and it made me more stressed out.  But the email and punishment didn't do anything, I was still skipping.  I somehow managed to pass last year with the pass/fail system they implemented last year.  I thought this year would be different I would get shit handled, but since day one, can't concentrate during zooms, turning in half of the assignments and I have 3 classes I have As in and 3 that I have a C- D+ and an F in.  Parent teacher conferences are tomorrow, and I am freaking out. I think I have no choice but to tell my parents before the conference so it comes from me and not them. I am fucking up so badly though in these classes.  Just procrastinating work and unlike previous grades they don't chase you down if you don't have it.  My parents are pretty strict.  They are going to be out of their minds pissed. And I don't think I can handle it, I've never had to do this where I've had to reach out and ask for help.  I'm just so terrified of telling my parents I'm repeating my same mistakes.  Please can someone talk to me?  Just 15 minutes or so just PM me if you can thank you\n",

Im still taking this math class where I sit there with a bunch of people younger than me and I dont have a clue of what I just heard after 2 hours of wasted time on stupid math. Next, my piano teacher is sooo stressful! Every week I have something one day of the week. Then, when my piano comes im not so good at is and my piano teacher shouts at me. Shes called me \"lazy\" twice and she says \"DANG GONIT, COME ON!\" and it just BUILDS to my stress level. After comes my grades. My grades are worse than last year and Im just on the verge of crying every day. Before all of this one of my oldest friends started acting up and not being herself for so long. I ended our friendship since she just leaning on me and then getting mad at me for all these little things that were not my fault. Im  just..so depressed.\n",

My bowel movements were regular, I avoided foods that I was allergic to, and the doctor could not find anything wrong. But I did not mention my stress to her at the time. After this visit, I took a blood test and an ultrasound, but I seemed to be in perfect health. Then, we saw a GI doctor, and I finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain.

My father has a good, stable job, and is paid well enough, but my mother doesn't have a job and he has two children. We try not to spend too much money, but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible. So I stopped taking therapy after we moved cities.\n",

I also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that I was causing him. I love my father a lot, and I don't want to trouble him any more than I already do. So I started lying to him and saying that my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. I thought I would be able to keep up the lie, but the pain seems to only be getting worse. What should I do?\n",

            " \n",
            "My grandfather is 89 years old with dementia & is physically extremely weak. In terms of willpower, he’s so stubborn it’s completely destructive & selfish. My mother is worn completely down & I don’t think she’ll ever come back from it. Our relationship was already severely strained with her commitment to martyring her awful relationship with my dad (her husband) & martyring being a caretaker for my grandparents (her parents). There’s no emotional hygiene practices in my family. I can’t fault my mom for trying her best to take good care of my grandfather tonight though. She hasn’t had a full nights sleep in year because of him, & I’m honestly so frustrated at his arrogance & selfishness that he doesn’t even realize he’s displaying. He’s just spent his whole life socialized as being to do what he wants, when he wants, & now he doesn’t care how much disturbance he causes everyone else.\n",

            "Just tonight my grandfather is blatantly ignoring my moms pleas to stop trying to pull off his depends cause he can’t pee the bed, especially while on dialysis, he can just pee the depends. He can’t stand at all, so he can’t travel to the bathroom even but he still tries to roll out of bed, which is terrifying cause his bones are so fragile & his skin is like paper. So here’s my mother & I trying to carry him onto a portable toilet so he’ll stop his fussing for just 20 minutes so my mom can rest a little bit while he settles down, & in comes my dad lecturing us about how he’s only doing it for attention. Meanwhile, my dad hasn’t been there for the past 2 hours every 5 minutes with us trying to stop him from hurting himself & causing more work & stress for my mom. In my dads eyes, an 89 year old with dementia can be trained, even though my grandfather clearly refuses to pee himself.\n",

All while refusing to eat cause he’s convinced we’re giving him poison.\n",

            "I wish my mom didn’t argue & challenge my brother & I when we were the only 2 in the family to vote against my grandfather getting dialysis a decade ago. He was already old & actively against it, he didn’t want to live a longer life. But my mom & the rest of the family steamrolled over that & now the dialysis has kept him alive but with no quality of life. And in turn, my mom has no quality of life. She hasn’t been able to leave the house in 4 years aside from grocery shopping & appointments because a nurse or herself always needs to be present for him, especially with the complications of diabetes. \n",
            "\n",
            "I love my grandfather very much. I don’t want to see him suffering like this, but I don’t want to see him exacerbating my moms suffering. I’m frustrated & confused at this resentment for my mom putting herself in this situation & doing this before in numerous parallel situations where she doesn’t care for herself so I’m left to pick up the pieces, & I’m frustrated to see her hurting. There’s nothing more I can do but I just needed to rant.\n",

            "Edit to add: my father has a temper as well. Growing up he was violent with us, but now it’s scary seeing how he thinks my grandfather is intentionally being more difficult than he intends to be. He comes in yelling “if you’re gonna be unreasonable then we WILL control you” which isn’t something my mother or I agree with. If I argue with my dad, my mom gets stressed out about it. Even though my grandfather is infuriating & unreasonable to no end, it’s scary having my dad become a ticking time bomb just waiting to blow up on him & I’m so scared of how far he might take it. \n",

But shortly after hiring, management figured out how to make the drive in theater run more efficiently, so they cut the hours of their employees down in favor of having more people work for less time. Because of that, I've been making shit money for the past month and I neglected to find a supplementary job to help earn more money or just flat out find a new one. And now it's already practically August and I've been trying to find an additional temp job that will hire me for the month of August before I go back to university in September (which is unlikely) but with predictably no luck. I think my only option is to just stick with this shit paying job until I go back to school. But going into this summer, I wanted to earn money before my fall semester. But now, I've managed to secure the worst job ever and now I can't find a new one because I neglected to find another one sooner.

He was and still is my brother from another mother. Fast forward 3 months and he leaves back to the US. He was here on a foreign exchange program. When he left everything returned. I began feeling depressed, anxious and stressed as fuck. Not to mention my exams which were to happen in 2 weeks. I didn't give a shit about them anyways and we had a school trip to Geneva, Switzerland and this trip was everything. It was amazing. I return to the school after a week, and exams began the week after. I failed science, had a terrible report card and my mom was embarrassed of me and called me a disappointment and even went as far to threatening to kick me out. She ended up destroying my PC which i built as a birthday present, and video games was my escape to everything.

(She's in her late 30s) (me and my boyfriend are in our mid 20's) I've never seen her partner after that. Though out the years we have tried knocking on her door asking her to move her car for snow removal, and to maybe split with us to get the whole driveway plowed but she never answers her door even if we know she's in there. So we noticed that our garbage bin was full of loose garbage for a while, not ours, we cleaned it out put it in bags and took it to the curb....the next week it was full again (dog poop, baby dipers) (the neighbour just got a dog last summer) we empty it again wanting to use our garbage bin......the next week it's full again so we leave it. (It's been full for 3 months now and no one has touched it) so a week later we go to put our compost into our compost bin, and it's full of garbage, the same kinda loose stuff in the bin. We have no idea what to do with our compost now last week we took it and put it in our downstairs neighbors compost bin at the curb...... ( Now I don't know if it's actually her garbage, bug I've always seen her garbage in the ally and never at the curb including when she had bags) to me I know it's her but I don't know what to do about it. If I try to get ahold of her she ignores the door, and if I leave a note on her door she will probably just chuck it and be made at us cause she's untitled.

            "I’ve worked seasonally at this job in 2017, then came back again in 2018. They decided to keep me and eventually I worked my way up to a manager position earlier this year. At the beginning I did enjoy working here and helping people out. But I have been recently feeling extremely stressed and burnt out from work. As a manager I have a long list of tasks to do everyday, while managing others, and dealing with customers. I would say I’m a hard worker, and getting tasks done is normally doable for me. The thing that gets me is having to deal with people, especially as I am an introvert and work full time so I have little time to recharge. And with the holidays coming, customers are very aggressive and it triggers my fight or flight instincts. I get frustrated when people come up to me to ask a question as it is disrupting my tasks I need to get done, which I feel really bad about. It just feels like an instinct reaction to me that’s hard for me to control. \n",

I’ve had multiple people threaten to call corporate about me for me simply following the rules, one of those people actually did call corporate about me and lied about the situation. I had a woman come up to me acting passive aggressive towards me. My anxiety normally shows itself as anger or frustration, which has become difficult to hide and put on a front for others to see. Got a complaint to my boss from her about me and how I didn’t say you’re welcome for showing her where something was. On top of that we have another manager who has been causing issues, as well as forcing me and others to have to alter our hours/schedule. The final straw for me was today when I got yelled at by my district manager for not completing something. I tried to hold my tears back but towards the end I couldn’t hide my shaky voice. She confronted me about it and I broke down. What really pissed me off is I know she doesn’t care about my stress, she seemed more worried that “there was now a crying manager”.  It’s just a bunch of little encounters that nag at me when I try to sleep at night. They build up and I just exploded today. \n",

I want to be an artist but in order to work my way there I need to be creating. But by the time I’m off work I’m exhausted mentally and physically. I’ve become pessimistic and cynical again. I feel hopeless that if I don’t make a change soon I will be stuck in customer service forever, which makes me feel suicidal. I’ve been looking for other jobs but nothing seems like it would be better. Also when I get complaints, I reflect on it for days and think about myself as a person and how people see me. I feel terrible for not being more welcoming and friendly like I used to be, but at the same time I’m angry at the customers for being rude to me. \n",

I worry that all of the stress will trigger a depressive episode, which for me is debilitating. The stress has also triggered mania for me before. I just feel like I cannot be a manager anymore, and I want to leave the customer service industry forever. I’m just scared to do something about it. I know this post was long, but it’s been a rough month for me. I don’t want to bother my friends about my problems but I just needed a place to rant until I can get a therapy appointment. I also wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced this stress and burnout from work and how they handled it. I’ve been hysterically crying all night and I just can’t take it anymore.\n",

So, I started writing things down when I got stressed. I recorded how I felt, what was happening in my environment, and what time of day it was. I also tried journaling a bit at night and performing **self-checks** throughout the busy day. I learned that you have to start talking to yourself. You have to ask yourself *how you’re doing.* From this experience, I found patterns in my stress behaviour. I use [Stress Free](http://katieclear.com/course) to keep track of my daily trends.\n",

No matter what you blame your stress on (your environment, your boss, your spouse, your kids), at the end of the day, **your stress is your fault.** Okay, external factors like poverty or an unhealthy marriage obviously don’t facilitate being stressed, but it comes down to realizing that you’re the problem. Until you stop blaming external factors for your stress, you can’t fix it. For example, if you blame your job for your stress, your brain is convinced that the stress will only go away if the job goes away! You’re practicing **self-helplessness**. Before you can make changes, come to the realization that you’re the one making yourself stressed. I know it’s mean, but that’s life.\n",

            "**Feel grateful for what you have.** Sometimes I forget to be grateful for what I have.

It’s hard to meditate at first. It’s hard to sit in silence and ask yourself tough questions. I mean, when do we ever experience complete silence anymore?

Within a couple of weeks (yes, the first few days were hard!), I noticed I felt less anxious and I no longer craved buying sweets on my weekly trip to the grocery store. When I added a small salad to my daily diet, I noticed my hair was growing faster and my nails got stronger. So, you don’t have to eat only kale. Just try branching out and eating some veggies you wouldn’t normally eat. Take it one day at a time, and turn it into a habit. Habits are your worst enemy, but they can also be your best friend (when you take the time to develop good habits).\n",

It's cheap and almost side effect-free (mild headache if you have too much) so you wouldn't be risking anything, it's a protein found in tea normally and an antagonist to caffeine, lessening caffeine's side-effects as well as boosting its effect. Having had a lot of caffeine in the past I feel a drastic effect on both anxiety and clearmindedness, but I know that it doesn't work that way for everyone (even if the combination with caffeine guaranteedly works), but in case it does, I thought I'd share the info, it really revolutionised things.\n",

I am having difficulty expressing it. In school, other than the tremendous amount of weighted assignments I have to deal with, I still have to be committed to my cocurricular activity afterwards. I’m currently struggling to play my instrument well, I tried.  I really did try, but there’s no motivation for me at all. I feel so demoralised every time the conductor singles me out and makes me play alone, finally concluding that my junior plays better than me and I shouldn’t play for that part. As a senior I really feel ashamed but I don’t have the time to stay dedicated to practices. Studies is especially important to me this year and people just don’t get that I have my own priorities too. I recognise my mistake for not being passionate enough but I really feel that there’s nothing I can do about it, it’s already too late. This whole cycles just keeps repeating itself - me trying my best to score well, me going for band, me getting scolded in front of everyone, me feeling really sad and demoralised, me crying when I get back home, me doing my homework till midnight...I’m trying my best to stay committed to everything as much as possible already, why can’t they understand? Why do I feel like they are just trying to prove me wrong by shaming me? Thankfully, these practices are stopping in June and I can finally take a mental break by then. \n",

            " \n",
            "Last week I received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment. It was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard, each student is signed in with their student number. That at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it  because I came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when I did not plagiarise. The email required me to have an interview with three people, tutor, unit coordinator and an observer (but I am not obliged to go, but I did anyways). The email notified me to bring the person I plagiarised off from.. but the thing is I actually don't know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone?  I did call them up and said I did have a friend to GUIDE me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all, basically does a different course completely, same uni but different campus. So fast forward to the date of the interview I was pretty confident of clearing my innocent, I brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name?  I blurted out who's that by accident. So during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons, only one question consisting ABC were exactly the same!!! HOW UNCANNY?? The thing is, that was only like 10% of the assignment. I do understand their point of view, out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers. So some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how I got the working out for these questions, my dumbass really did guess it but I was able to explain how I got it, the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong AND plagiarised it. But my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PLAGIARISE? I did say I got them off the lecture notes but I really have no idea how I have the same answers as the other person. \n",
            "\n",
            " Anyways, during the interview, they were trying to throw my friend and I under the bus to admit to at least cheating, which we did not. All assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only. They were trying to imply I was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions. They were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions, thank god he kept saying I only GUIDED her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him (which he actually did only guided me because I am trash at maths). (They said if you did get a tutor for this assignment, that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work). But seriously what the hell, I actually don't know anyone in this subject because it is all online (lol I barely attended the online lectures, it is summer break after all). After the interview they're just telling me to think about who I plagiarised off from, so this is just implying I'm already screwed because I have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter. There are two guidelines I have to follow which is regardless brutal, if I did plagiarise (record, fines, etc)  and if I did not. If I did not I'm still not off the hook. Basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason, I can't prove my innocence. When I walked outside the room,  I think the person who I apparently plagiarised was there, I have never seen them before in my life. I'm just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like, what if the person said I did but I didn't? They school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear??? I can't prove my innocence, how can they prove my plagiarism? The unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he can't clear it, the dean has to?????? I just have to  wait for a dreading email what to do and more interview(s). I have two final exams left for summer and I just can't clear my head for this unnecessary problem (one of the the exams is this subject). I NEED TO STUDY.\n",

I have a particularly noisy set of kids, one on the spectrum with sensory seeking issues and one that loves to follow his big bro with the jumping and loud noises. We are currently upstairs tenants and have had issues with complaining neighbors from the noise but for some great Divine reason we always have most of our downstairs neighbors move out close to summer when the kids are out of school and that helps a lot with the worrying of noise complaints. Long story short, new neighbors moved in this week so I have a whole month of trying to keep my kids from being noisy, I’m super stressed and trying to decide should I approach my neighbor and explain why my kids are noisy and hope for understanding or tie my kids down (just kidding). I’m really trying to stop them from being noisy but I have this impending doom feeling like i will have issues with the new neighbors because of this. Sorry for the long post, run on sentences and such. \n",

I can’t go on meds because I literally don’t have TIME to go through crazy mood swings like everyone in my family does when they go on meds). Home life is a mess and I’m kind of the only “good” one who keeps it together so I can’t really have a full blown meltdown (that I feel could happen any minute) because I’m the only stable one while everyone else is too busy losing their shit. My relationship isn’t doing great because we both feel really distant but we don’t have any extra time for each other and we keep pissing each other off. I have school coming in September and I have no idea how I’m gonna pay for it when I really need to save up for a car.

            "The stress response is commonly known as the “fight or flight” response, and it begins in the brain. When a stress is perceived, the amygdala sends a signal to the hypothalamus, which activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream. Adrenaline then accelerates the heartbeat to pump more blood to the muscles in preparation for “flight.” In addition, the pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rate all increase to enhance the amount of oxygen inhaled. Other senses, such as sight and hearing, become sharper.\n",

            "During the second phase of the stress response, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands, which ensures that the body remains on “high alert.” Cortisol levels remain elevated until the threat passes; the stress response is then shut down once the brain perceives that the threat is no longer there (http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response).\n",

When the school actually expelled me, my mom was belligerent and furious that she made me clean everything in the entire house and told me she will never enroll me in a physical school which is very hypocritical because she and my dad were in real high school. So then she started freaking out because my failure would embarrass her so she kept calling all the school supervisors to basically say that kicking a student out of the school because they are struggling is wrong. So I was accepted back in and given an extended deadline. It's now only 10 days before ny deadline and I have three classes to complete not only am I stressed out supremely by this deadline but also by my parents putting pressure on me and constantly being mean and cruel to me. Now we have been having more problems because they \"don't know what to do with me\" im a 17 year old women and my dad treats me with no respect and expects me to treat him like a god damned king. He actually hits me pretty hard in the head when he's mad and says I'm being disrespectful but honestly I don't respect him at all I only pretend to. My mom us constantly saying there's something wrong with me and that if - in this time of utter stress - I don't change how I act she will take me to a psychologist. She is so fucking blind she doesn't see that my mood swings and irritability are from her and dad coming up to me when im happy and peaceful and literally picking a fight with and from the immense stress, expectations, and pressure I'm under. \n",

My aunt husband brother suffered from real mental issues, and her husband would say how if i didn't stop getting mad I would become mental just like his brother.

My sister and cousins get mad to, but they are not subjected to this type of wording from them,only me.  I have always bottled it up for many years, and it seems that now I'm 20 years old. It's all just coming out in anger towards them. Other things in my life, and including this has made me really stressed out in life. I can't afford any sort of help so thats out of the question. \n",

The review was given publically in front of the team and I felt so humiliated for not having a good system in place. It was the first company review and in hindsight I feel like one of the more experienced staff should have been targeted first so I could learn from their review, but all the same I feel like this was mistake number 1 in my manager's head.

My father is a stubborn old mess who just turned 60 but has the body of a 80 yr old. He works every day and he's rich (millionaire), but lives such a mundane life. He works (capital investments), comes home, watches TV, eats poorly (although much better now), smokes and thankfully just quit drinking (after i broke down telling him he has to pull his life together, if not for himself, at least so his children don't follow in his path). He has way more money than he'll ever need and I've told him multiple times he should quit his job and do something that he enjoys. He is the crutch of my family. I have a 26 year old brother who barely graduated highschool and is FULLY supported by my father. Dude just plays video games all day and eats toaster strudels or whatever else my dad stocks up in his freezer. I have a 22 yr old brother that has never held a job.

I wasn't sure i'd ever be able to forgive my mother for divorcing him but as I get older, I see things much differently. Meditation has helped me a lot to gain perspective in life. At one point I even admired her for living her life happily, but all of that has changed. She hasn't worked a day in her life since we were born. I give her all the credit she deserves for raising us well, but she's greedy as hell. Her greatest concern is that she has the money to do what she wants. Not only does she receive alimony from the divorce, she also CHARGES my father for almost everything she buys. She just fucking gives him a total and has him write her a check (not to mention she adds on more or as she jokingly says \"adds interest\" and doesn't even bother to hide it from him)\n",

After implementing this myself, I have noticed how much my willpower has grown just due to the idea that \"I have achieved so much already, I am capable of achieving more.\" I feel as though this method works so well to alleviate mental stress of any sort because it almost *tricks* the mind into thinking that you are safe and there is nothing to worry about. \n",

            "Several weeks after I finally tested negative to COVID-19 I had a severe panic attack on my way back to college followed by constant anxiety and severe stress most of the time since late August. I had dealt with severe anxiety similar to what I have been experiencing over the past two months years ago when I was in elementary in middle school, so to have this come back and effect my life here at college to the extent at which it does is extremely upsetting to me. I feel extremely anxious most of the time and for some reason I have developed a sort of phobia of looking up at the sky. When I look up at the sky I begin to feel extremely dizzy, anxious, and a panic attack is not too far behind. I initially believed I had vertigo but it was more recently that I realized that these feelings I have begun to experience are a result of extreme stress and anxiety which is caused by something which I do not know or understand. When I am either drinking with friends, smoking, actively doing something, or basically doing things with people I do not feel most of these feelings most of the time but when I am alone and stuck in my own head I cant help these feelings from totally overwhelming me. I have not spoken to anybody about this really so after. My mental health currently is extremely poor as the anxiety and occasional panic attacks are something of the likes I have never experienced before. I have never used reddit before but I am thought it would be a good idea to reach out to see if there is anyone out there who is in a similar situation to me and who would like to talk about it.

Plus we are over the funeral arrangements for both my mom and my father in law. Trying to hold everyone together and ourselves has been taxing. He’s on anxiety medication and doesn’t have to take it very often, only as needed, and recently he’s needed it a lot. Just feeling overwhelmed.

I’ll think about that email I should have sent but forgot to; or about how I’m going to explain something to my boss tomorrow because he was out today; etc. When I think of these types of stressors, I overthink to a point where my wife even starts commenting because I’ll get really quiet and concentrated when we watch tv or we’re doing something.

This was also a short week for me as I had previously put in time for my birthday so I really only had to work for 2 days then I would have a week off. On the 2nd day and the last day before my vacation my Senior manager asked me if I would be willing to come to day shift after my vacation was over.

I do let him know that my back hurts, but for the most part I am unable to work a full week through all of October. I am leaving early because it hurts and taking additional days off.  He was always understanding of my health issues though. Or I thought he was. Just a few days into November I finally decide to make the call and go to the doctor.

This was in California. I was unable to find anything that I could afford on my own. 1 thing I did not mention is that I have a son. So I have to have a 2 bedroom.

I get a hold of the GM and let him know to see if that would be an issue. He said no and that I would have an offer letter before then. Well flash forward to the 24th of Feb I still have not gotten my offer letter. I sent the contact I am supposed to be working with at the new site a message but he just assures me they are working on it and says the start date will be the 3rd. Its already the 24 so I rush and let my current site know what is going on. They tell me they can't help me until I get an offer letter. But being backed into a corner, If I don't leave immediately I won't make it to the new site by the 3rd... They will NOT help with out an offer letter.

I had to request a personal leave because I used my time to make it out to Kentucky. Personal leaves are 2 weeks long minimum. Other than covid disaster everything was good. 3 days back from personal leave I get a sore throat and get told to stay home and get check out. I do, its negative... they have me stay home for 2 weeks just in case. The day before I came back I hurt my ankle being a douche.... I was looking at my phone and missed a step at the apartment. I still went to work, but went home early.  So the first week back from leave I went home roughly an hour or so every night because of my swollen ankle.. now, I was still registered as on leave because of how backed up the leave team was.  Because of that, I could not submit my time right away. \n",

I very quickly found myself staring at HR and an Ops asking me how I intended to cover all of this time including the time from the 2 week leave... They MADE me take the 2 weeks off. I don't know why it was denied. All I know is when I call they can't tell me why it was denied. They just keep saying it looks good and should be approved. I go through this for a month. During this month I also get asked to perform a termination due to safety reasons. I end up denying to do it because they had been outspoken on certain things and just felt wrong??? I don't know, I just got bad vibes. I have done many terms, but that had bad mojo. And did not win me any points. I know they hate me... I had been there for 3 months and had barely worked for a month of it. Then we get to June, I actually do come into contact with Covid so I take myself out of work, then I get covid. Basically, coming into contact I was out a week, then I felt the symptoms, add another 2 weeks. They have given me issues through all of it. And I still don't know why I was denied the first time.

He depends on me but I can't find the will to actually care if I get fired. I go back to work tomorrow and I don't know what to do. I don't want to go. Period. I really don't. But I have to, if for no other reason, oh yea, I never mentioned. Because I transferred out here I am locked in a 2 year contract thing. They can fire me.

            "Hello hello, this is my first post so i have no clue what i'm doing, just wanted to see if anyone else is going through what I'm currently experiencing, which isn't that great to be honest. Long story short, I had my first girlfriend early last year, nice girl but I put in all the effort whether it was generally hanging out or planning trips. Basically to see her I would have to ask like 95% of the time, and over time looking back now it stressed me out, a lot. She kept saying she loved me blah blah blah, we were great when we met up but when she left, the whole process would start again, I'd have to eventually ask her if she wanted to do something of which she didn't seem bothered at all. Over time it got to me like hell, and by the end of the relationship I think I experienced a stress burnout, my mind completely melted about early September. I would wake up and my mind would be doing back flips, constantly over thinking everything I had going on, mostly her. My heart would be constantly beating out my chest and the main thing, everything around me changed, the whole world became so bleak, depressed and dark. In the first days I struggle to not burst out in tears, this is when I realised that this was a problem. So I went to the doctors and they said it was stress, but at the time I didn't want to believe it was her so completely pushed it out of my mind. Obviously the time came where I realised and my heart sank, so I had to call it quits (Plus it was quite a messy break up as she didn't quite understand, this happened in late October last year). I had a really shitty Christmas, my family knew and were generally supportive and tried to help of which I'm really thankful for them to understand it to some degree. But I'm on the way up, but still getting the bad days, more good than bad now but I just feel constantly on edge, most of the time I can feel my heart beating whether it being fast or normal, the dark depressive outlook has become more positive, but still constantly overthinking thing.\n",

            "So I work at a restaurant/retail store as a hostess and a server. I've been trying to cross train to other positions for the last year and a half. It started when I told my manager I wanted to be a grill cook and he literally laughed in my face and told me I couldn't handle it. So I talked to the employee trainer and she said it'd be better to start as a back-up or prep cook. So we talked to the manager and I was going to cross train to back-up but then they came up with the excuse that someone else had just come back from surgery recovery and they didn't have any hours (even though they hired someone else a month later). So then I was going to be a prep cook, even did all of the computer course work and everything but when it came time for me to actually train with a person, there weren't any hours. (Coincidentally the person they hired for back-up is also a prep cook now and training on grill) So the retail side has a separate manager but the general manager is still her boss, and I talked to her this December and she said she'd love to have me on her team, she says I'm a hard worker. So I went to my general manager to cross train and he tried to tell me no, \"because they need me for the restaurant\" but the RM talked to him and I was finally able to get my computer training done and I even got to go to one of their meetings! It's a lot of fun and I was supposed to be training with them this week but now the restaurant side is scheduling me all week and I can't fit in any training! At what point do I put my foot down? I grew up as a freaking mat and I don't know how to stand up for myself. They've been walking all over me from day one. I've tried looking for another job but I'm terrible at interviews so I haven't been able to get one. I don't know what to do but somehow I keep turning it on myself. Why didn't I speak up sooner? Why don't I do something now? Why can't I stand up to my manager? Do I like keeping myself stuck in this rut? All of this on top of pressure from my family to go back to college (because I dropped out because it's not where I wanted to be and it was reflected in my grades) and trying to keep up with monthly expenses, and helping my roommate deal with her depression, and my car is slowly falling apart and I can't afford to fix it, or get a new one.

            "I started high school around 3 months ago. In middle school I was pretty much always an honor student. My anxiety and stress issues started at around 8th grade but now it’s much worser. First of all, I’m taking physics in 9th grade. It deals with some trigonometry which I didn’t learn yet. I was pretty good at subjects dealing with science but physics is a totally different story. I didn’t score such low grades on my exams in a very long time. It’s hard to even keep my average around an 85. I also started having trouble with geometry. I understand all the class material but when it comes to tests, I always mess up so miserably. It’s not that I don’t study beforehand. I don’t know if I just don’t study enough or I’m just not good at the subject. I also encountered problems for ELA. I wrote an essay a few weeks back and it was returned recently with a grade of 75. I had absolutely no problem with essay writing or ELA classes before. What dragged my grade down the most was my grammar and sentence structure. My teacher said she highly suggests for me to get a workbook or use grammarly to check my mistakes. After all the countless essays I’ve written and the many teachers I had, they never really addressed the fact that I have grammar issues. I don’t know how to cope with this newly found problem that I never knew I had before. All I know is that if I don’t fix it, my ELA average is going to fall a lot. My ddp class(art class) is not bad, but the amount of projects stacked up are insane. Every time, there’s a new project that’s assigned even if you didn’t finish the last one. It’s not only my problem,  my classmates also feel the same way. Thing is I get home around 5 since I have a 3-10 period schedule and I live around 1 hour and 20 mins away from school. I have to take a bus and 2 trains to get there. I’m already pretty tired when I get home and I have a lot of things to do for ddp when I want to focus on other academic subjects. I feel I like have problems for every class I’m taking .-. Not only that I need to go to club to get club credits for college. I only ended up joining one club because I’m already pretty stressed about the time I have for homework and studying. During the first 1.5 month I started freshmen year I started having eating problems. I didn’t want to eat anything because my stomach automatically rejects the food. I pretty much understand that it was due to my anxiety and stress. I dread going to school and every time I wake up, my heart starts pounding like crazy and I feel really tense and nervous. That problem died down after a while but I still have really bad anxiety before quizzes and exams even if they’re a few days away. I don’t know if it’s a problem but I have 2-3 strands of silver/white hair and I’m only 14.-. All in all, I have absolutely no way to handle stress from the grades I receive or anything else relating to school. Any advice would be highly appreciated ^-^\n",

Yesterday after working my third 13 hour shift with only 4 hours sleep between each shift and having to skip breakfast and lunch due to work schedule, only 1 meal a day, I was standing up and rocking my 2 year old son trying to get him to fall asleep at 11:49 pm. Suddenly in an instant I felt my entire right side go numb. My right leg gave out and I fell. I felt myself starting to go down. I tried to catch myself with my right arm but it was numb too so I just fell and hit the table on the way down to the floor. Luckily I had my son secured in my left arm. After I hit the floor my wife asked what happened and grabbed my son. I kept asking if he was okay and I was worried he might have hit his head. She checked and said he was fine. There was no pain but it took me a good 20 minutes to regain full feeling in my right arm, hip and leg. I looked around online and found that it could be anything from a pinched nerve to a stroke. It’s now been 23 hours since the incident and the only pain I have is the soreness from hitting the table and the floor which I couldn’t feel at the time due to the numbness. Has anyone had an experience like this? Needless to say on a scale of 1 to 10, the stress in my life is a 750.\n",

For example, normally people would get mad if you gave them the middle finger. Well, in my house it's actually welcomed to do it to one another.

I was stopped for a minor traffic infringement and arrested, as there was a warrant against me for failure to appear in court as a witness (I was worried about COVID situation at that time, not the best choice!) Upon arrest, I was taken to jail, where I was forcefully strip searched on admission (by forcefully I mean that I was unable to refuse the invasive procedure, although I tried - no physical force was used). It was a traumatizing experience to say the least, totally unwarranted and unnecessary (I have had a good character record, with no prior trouble with the law). I am so confused, as I thought the Police couldn't strip search me without probable cause. They did not, but the county jail did so, as it was jail's \"standard policy\"? So why is there a law (I think) not to strip search people arrested for minor offences if the jail staff can do it anyway? Do I have a chance if I challenge what's happened to me in court?

            "I’m 17f and I live in California, and since March a boy who I’m almost 100 percent sure is her son as been living in my neighbors house. She’s overall a very unpleasant and malicious person, but we’ve never had legal troubles before or seen this boy before early this year at the start of lockdown. I didn’t even notice he was there at first, I only heard him playing basketball in his yard, but almost two dozen times since at least early June we’ve heard my neighbor screaming and berating her son to the point where I considered calling the police, and at one point she shoved him out of the house and made him sit on the porch at midnight in the cold while he begged to be let back inside, saying he would just kill himself if it would make it easier for her. At one point later that month I had heard her audibly strike her son and then lock him outside, so I finally called the police. They showed up in about 10 minutes, went inside and left 15 minutes later. The screaming continued about 20 minutes after the police left and she at that point locked him in his room. My bedroom is right next to his, separated by a small walkway and a fence, about 5 feet apart, so it’s not hard to hear this happening. I’ve filed at least 3 CPS reports about the abuse and my concern for this child. This little boy can’t be much older than 11, all the clothes he wears are so small on him, and he’s very shy and soft spoken anytime I’ve tried to engage him in conversation about his dog or his puppy, I try to at least let him know that we’re friendly and I’m happy to talk with him, as I’m the only other minor on the street. \n",
            "\n",
            "This was the last I heard from there until last month where the abuse escalated. On the 24th at around 12:30 I heard the mother enter her sons bedroom and begin screaming at him at the very top of her lungs, about his room being messy. I could hear her throwing things against the wall while he cried and begged her to stop. It sounded like she locked him in his room for a few minutes before it sounded like she either hit him or threw him on the ground because there was a loud thump and him screaming in what sounded like pain. She then threw him out of the house onto her front steps and locked him outside, while he begged to be let back in. The screaming was something I had literally never heard before, the entire neighborhood heard it, and a few of my neighbors had texted my mom to make sure it wasn’t us in distress. My mom called 911 and let the dispatcher listen to the boy screaming and being threatened before she sent police over, and I encouraged my mom to take a video from our porch to show officers, because my biggest fear is that the police aren’t believing how bad it is. The police did show up and nothing happened even after several people called the police, at least 10 of our neighbors called the police on this woman. I told my mom that our best bet is to record to document this happening so we have at least something to show officers or our landlord if this woman accuses us of calling the police to make false reports. \n",
            "\n",
            "Just a few days later this happened again, over what I know was him doing homework on his mother’s computer. She kicked him out in the middle of the day and screamed at him, while he cried and begged to just “do his math”. My mom took video and the neighbor saw, and then took her son down into the garage to yell at him without my mother being able to see. Any time we’ve called the police we’ve said we have video, but an officer never comes to talk to us. \n",

            "At this point I don’t know what to do, the system is failing this poor kid. I don’t know what else to do, is there anything I can do besides keep calling the police and CPS? Do I need to go into my local police department to show someone the evidence we have? What rights do we have when it comes to reporting this woman and can we get in trouble? Any advice helps, I really just want to help this little boy.\n",

My 9 month old son was in the back seat in his baby carrier. He was asleep perfectly fine but I knew I wasn't feeling well so I knew I had to park my car or else I wouldn't be able to drive anymore and maybe get in an accident. So I did just that. As soon as I parked. I passed out. next happens. I wake up police are knocking on my window open the door they take me out of the car and I'm taken to the hospital and told that if I want to see my son again I will have to give them my blood to see what I am on. I was not too worried about that because I only wanted to see my son again even though I knew he was okay I love him so much I just wanted to see him even just for a moment because knew I was going to go to jail. They take my blood and I know that it would show that I only took in the Xanax and oxycodone. I had been truthful with them and told them what I had taken anyways. After that they booked me I kept demanding to see my son but I knew I probably wouldn't have seen him anyways because his father I probably already picked him up. Skip forward about 3 and 1/2 days later my fiance AKA baby daddy had bonded me out from the $3,400 bond. Dchs have visited me the day after I bonded out. I did a urine test to show that I had not taken any drugs after that and of course I passed. They made me sign some paperwork after they have been inspected the house my son and everything else saying that my son will remain in my care as well as my fiance's. Basically case closed. My court day is on 12/9/2020. I have tried several times to get in contact with my attorney who is court appointed. I have not been able to contact him because they're saying that I would be able to talk to him on court day but I would like to be able to talk to him before that. For obvious reasons. I do not have any intention to use this medication for resale at all. And I mean AT ALL!!!! SO I FEEL LIKE THE SCHEDULE FOR AND SCHEDULE TOO SHOULD BE DROPPED DOWN TO MISDEMEANORS. I put my application in for judicial diversion since I have no other record of getting in trouble with the law. let me just go ahead and make this clear I have no prior charges other than the ones I'm being charged with right now. I have no other criminal record whatsoever so I am wondering what I should do about my attorney and how I should be able to contact him before my court date. And if me putting in my judicial diversion application will help me. Also do they drug test you on court day even for alcohol? I had no alcohol whatsoever in my bloodstream when I was arrested just to be clear. I just don't want them to think that I am a bad parent even if I occasionally drink. Please help me because I do not know what to do. I don't want to lose my son. I don't want to go back to jail. What are some steps I need to take in order to ensure I don't go back. I can understand if they could drop it down to possession because that's what I had. I don't have a drug problem I've already taken a urine test and like I said I passed. but I can stop for my son any day because he is not worth losing and I am willing to show that to them. By the way I am female 24 years old, not married and have no prior criminal history besides one speeding ticket and that's it. Every time I try to call my lawyer who I do not know his or her name or even if they have appointed one in their system yet for me what should I do? Like I said I did put in my application for judicial diversion. I do not have enough money to hire an attorney that isn't Court appointed.\n",

Turns out, the phone number on the letter is a legitimate Liberty Mutual number and this was a legitimate claim. Only thing is, I don't understand why they think I'm involved/responsible or how they got my information to begin with. It also reminded me of something that happened a few days ago when I was trying to get an insurance quote through my own company for a car I was looking at. It wouldn't let me continue because it said there was an accident on my record they couldn't determine the fault so I needed to submit evidence of me being not at fault. I assumed it was from a previous accident I had 2 months prior to this one but now I'm thinking it could possibly be this since I went through my insurance for the other accident so they should know the outcome. \n",

            "Today I just played Dark Souls for the first time and wow people were not joking, this game is pretty damn good so far. I was expecting a game that pulls no punches and is incredible difficult. Instead I found a challenging but fair game that has amazing combat that makes you feel amazing. I absolutely love the combat in this game, it is so satisfying to kill enemies in this game since you have to think and strategize before you act. It reminds me of Jedi Fallen Order which was amazing fun but you needed to have skill to beat it, same thing with Dark Souls. The Undead Asylum is one of the best beginnings to a video game ever. It is straightforward, teaches you everything about the game with creepy messages, and within the first 2 minutes you are already at the first boss. That shit caught me off guard and i ran for dear life. I then got a cool sword and shield and some estus flasks which are so amazing in this game, I already know I will need it a lot on the future. I then tackled the first boss again and I beat him but I wasted about 4 of my estus flasks, still felt satisfying though. Then a weird bird took me to the Fire link Shrine and can I just say I love this hub world and it's music. The first place I went to was New Londo Ruins which I quickly realized was not suited for my level. After that, i found Undead Burg which was so much fun. I stopped playing about when it reached the first bonfire of Undead Burg. This game so far is meeting my expectations and more. I am so glad to have finally played one of these games and I can already tell that this game will be a legendary gaming experience!\n",

            "**My List:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Artorias of The Abyss:** The reason I put this over the old hunters is that, simply, this DLC has no weak points. There are three areas, all of which are good to excellent areas. I love the atmosphere of both The Abyss and Oolacile Township. The four bosses are all high quality. You can put three of the bosses in this DLC as being the best in the series. Manus, Artorias, Kalameet are all excellent fights whilst The Gaurdian is quite underrated. Whilst I think the areas and bosses of TOH are better, AOTA is simply more consistent. There is also the inclusion of a PVP arena, I don't play PVP so I won't know anything about it but I guess it adds more value to your money.\n",
            "2. **The Old Hunters:** This DLC goes neck and neck with AOTA, the value for money is insane as you have three unique areas, arguably better than what you get in AOTA. Furthermore, the weapons in this DLC are sick. The Beastcutter, The Whirligig saw and The Rakuyo are all insane weapons. The enemy design is great (except for those big headed people). The boss quality is also good. There is one dud boss, The Living Failure. It is kind of a waste of time and I believe the pacing and atmosphere of the Research Hall would have been better if you opened the big door and it cuts straight to Lady Maria's boss room, without the flower room breaking the pace. Furthermore, Laurence is also a controversial boss. I think he's quite average. It is true that he does way too much damage, but the fight in of itself is quite boring. But Ludwig, Maria and Orphan of Kos are all great fights.\n",
            "3. **The Ringed City:** Firstly, the areas in the DLC are quite disappointing and are very overrated. Honestly, there is a poison swamp area in the Dreg Heap, why? It's so unoriginal, this is supposed to be Dark Soul's swansong and you put one of the most hated tropes in the series in it? Even when you get rid of the angels the area feels quite empty. Then you get ANOTHER swamp, this time not poisonous, in the actual City. LAZY! You even get a boss from the main game just dropped into the area for no reason. I wish The Ringed City continued to be tight streets and narrow walk ways. The enemy design is fine, with the exception of The Ringed Knights who are a great enemy to fight when they are fought individually. The giant in the middle of the swamp is kinda annoying. The bosses are great, however, The Demon Prince is impressive because it gets down perfectly both a beast boss and a gank boss. Midir and Gael are both 10/10 boss fights when everything is considered. I love the lore of Gael. But the Spear of The Church is a crapshoot.\n",
            "4. **Crown of The Old Iron King:** The best DS2 DLC. This write up is getting long so i'll be quick. CTIK has two of the best bosses in the game and series. The level design of Brume Tower is interesting and the visuals are mesmerising. The optional area is shit though. The run up to Sir Allone is cancer. Why does FromSoft do this?\n",
            "5. **Crown of The Ivory King:** Frozen Elum Loyce is the best area in DS2 hands down, and is one of the best in the entire series. I love how your forced to re-explore the level again, but now it's bigger and more dangerous. This is what DS2 level design should have been in the first place. However, Raindeer fuck land is considered by most one of the worst areas in the series' history, I ain't brave enough to find out. The bosses are kinda shitty, yes it's cool invading hell, but the ivory king boss fight is bland. Ava ain't too difficult if you played all the other games, im guessing delayed attacks was a new thing back in 2014. Furthermore, FUCK MALDRON. How the fuck is an invader harder than the actual bosses of the DLC? I broke two weapons, chugged all my estus, used half my gems just to kill him.\n",
            "6. **Crown of The Sunken King:** The first flaw this DLC has it the enemy placement. The enemies themselves are very well designed but there are just too many of them. This whole DLC was a stressful and very angering experience because of this. The level design feels really gimmicky and game like, more like Zelda rather than a souls game. Elana is a great boss fight, if not a little bit unoriginal as she feels really similar to Nashandra or Darkluker. Sinh is decent but he flies around too much and is overshadowed by Kalameet and Midir.\n",
            "7. **Ashes of Ariandel:** It's basically Sister Friede and that's it. The dog boss fight is garbage. The areas are too small and lack any real things to do. The enemies range from good (The Millwood Knights) to bad (The Corvian Knights). The Lore is meh, the areas can look good. I feel sorry for the people who bought this DLC full price without the season pass.\n",

The art style, challenging yet fair and satisfying combat, and fluid world design in that game are just out of this world. I always found it really hard to get into Dark Souls though, for some reason it just didn't vibe with me the same way.

I know Blighttown is a controversial one, but I really like the vibe, and the fight with Quelaag is sweet. Difficulty is pretty well balanced there, as long as you have the spider shield. Undead Burg/Parish are really well-designed starting areas to learn the ropes. I had heard some bad things about Capra Demon, but I actually really like his moveset. Fun fight.  Anor Londo is incredible, but my one complaint is that it's a little too spaced out so the enemies feel kind of out of place at times. This is much more of an issue in Demon Ruins.\n",
            "\n",
            "* The Depths and New Londo ruins are just *okay*. The enemies in the Depths are pretty easy so the whole area is kind of boring, although the dragon is a pretty fun boss fight. New Londo Ruins is really cool from an artistic standpoint, but the ghosts are annoying as hell.

            "* Demon Ruins and Lost Izalith... kinda suck ass. Demon Ruins, as mentioned previously, just feels way too spaced out. That initial area where there are like 10 Taurus Demons copy-pasted onto the dull landscape is just so boring. Bait, roll, mash RB, repeat. Centipede Demon and Ceaseless Discharge are just okay. Seeing Lost Izalith for the first time after talking to the sun dude was a suuuuper cool moment, but it got dull pretty quickly. All of the enemies except the Titanite Demon are just way too easy: bait, roll, mash RB, repeat. I actually was trying to aggro as many at once just to make it a little more interesting.

What really stands out about this case was that a man (NOT Timothy Bidner) was heavily researching missing girls and even predicted the MONTH in which this girl would go missing. The girl's mother and this man communicated a lot as she felt he was the only listening to her (i assume police thought she was a runaway), the mother couldn't tell if the guy was involved or not but continued talking to him to get more information\n",

Came back they told me the knight dropped something, I thought wow!! What the hell!! Is it Helbret? or knight sword what is it? They say it is a suit!

            "He encountered the Hollows then. After a few minutes of remebring the buttons, and a backstep off the cliff, he was back in the zone. Killing all around him. I've never seen anything as reckless in this game, zero lock on and mashing R1 until everything is dead. He made it to the aquaduct and up to the Burg after a few attempts, and reached the fog gate. \n",
            "\n",
            "\"Is this a boss?\" he asked. \"Go through and find out\" I said. Phew, not a boss. He carried on, exploring every nook and cranny and picking up items. Out to the rooftops and all of a sudden DRAGON. He turned and ran like crazy back to the safety of the building he had just left.\" I knew there was a boss!, oh he's gone\". \n",
            "\n",

            "He climbed the ramp to kill crossbow guy. This was it, the first proper bonfire. HE WENT RIGHT, OVER THE BRIDGE INSTEAD. I was sure this would be a major setback, but he killed the three hollows in the next room, but was almost out of estus now. \n",
            "\n",
            "He tried the gate to the lower Burg, locked. I couldn't bear the thought of him being sent back to Firelink after all that, so I suggested checking back over the bridge, in case he missed anything... \n",
            "\n",
            "There it was. Bonfire. He was delighted! He had some humanity so I explained what kindling was and he headed back over the bridge, fully armed with Estus. Now, he hasn't quite grasped the mechanic of enemies respawning after resting at a fire, so had a few runs of getting ganked from both sides by hollows. I told him to try avoid being surrounded, and check his surroundings around before running ahead. \n",
            "\n",
            "He took the advice the heart and made good progress. He really enjoyed exploring the little houses and smashing all their furniture, and got a fright from the hollow hiding being the wall (you know the one).\n",
            "\n",
            "A few more tries and he was up to the roof with the three hollows, then something different happened. He saw there was three and said \"that's too many to fight, where are my bombs?\". A small session on equipment management later and he was creeping up the stairs to Firebomb the guys. He was spotted by one who came towards him, but instead of attacking my son backed off and let him come down the stairs. I said great job, you can kill him on his own now. Black Firebomb to the face, poor hollow...\n",

            "He didn't see the stairs down to the Black Knight unfortunately (or fortunately) and headed up. Took the flaming barrel full on, but it didn't kill him. He healed and killed the hollow. I was super excited we'd meet out next boss. \n",
            "\n",
            "But... He spotted the door in the tower, and it opened with the Master Key. I'll admit, I started my game with the Master Key, I didn't even notice that door, I didn't even find that shortcut to Darkroot Basin until NG+. He headed down, we were going to visit Havel. \n",
            "\n",
            "He reached the bottom, movement! \"what the hell is that?!\". He ran back up the stairs a few step and stood his ground ready to take a stab. Havel with the R2. One shotted, dead. Afterwards he said, oh it was a Knight, I thought the club was his head! \n",
            "\n",
            "I told him about Havel and explained that the master key will sometimes let you access areas that may be above your level so you must be cautious following those paths. \n",

            "He decided to finish there for today. Guys I am super proud yet again. He made it to the Undead Burg bonfire faster than I did on my first playthrough.

The case was handed to the Homicide division and listed as a suspicious death.\n",
            "\n",
            "The detectives that visited the scene noted dents to the rear bumper and the fire hydrant as well as some of the lettering that had come off the back of the Ford Escape due to the impact. Bloody hand prints were also photographed that trailed from the centre of the back of the SUV and down to the left of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "The police report stated that Wilson had sustained massive internal injuries and some superficial wounds and bruises, broken ribs, crushed kidneys and a ruptured spleen. Also of note was a large bruise across his back in the shape of the Hydrant. The police report stated that they believed he had started the SUV, left it in neutral and for some reason had then gotten out of the vehicle and walked to the fire hydrant, it was then that the SUV rolled back and crushed him between it and the hydrant. \n",
            "\n",
            "The report went on to state that it was the authorities belief he had then managed to get out from between the vehicle and fire hydrant before climbing back into the SUV and remained there until the police arrived, foul play was ruled out due to no robbery having occurred and no evidence anyone else had driven the SUV. \n",
            "\n",
            "Despite these claims, the report did allow that reconstructions and expert testimony has not all agreed on exactly what the sequence of events were and how Geoffrey made it out from between the hydrant and SUV and then back to the drivers seat with his injuries. The report finished off by stating that witnesses to the incident were needed to once and for all clear up any discrepancies.\n",

            "\n",
            "The family also had their doubts about the close friends story on the night in question, they didnt believe he would have called for a cab so quickly without first looking for Geoffrey and also due to the men sharing a hotel room that night, the family felt it would have quickly become obvious to him that Geoffrey hadnt made it back. \n",
            "\n",
            "The identity of the individual who made the 911 call to police around 3:10am was never revealed publicly and while police did question the friend soon after the incident he isnt considered to be involved as social media posts and local cctv corroborated his story. The Cab driver and a woman that the friend and Geoffry had met that night also stated that nothing had seemed amiss.\n",
            "\n",
            "The family doubted the official story that Geoffrey had been able to climb out from between the SUV and hydrant and then make it back into the SUV. They indicated the autopsy report mentioned his alcohol level was more then twice the legal limit at the time and combined with the extent of his injuries it was doubtful he was even conscious after the impact to be able to move. They suggested that he had been removed from between the hydrant and vehicle before being put back into the SUV by an unknown individual or individuals.\n",
            "\n",
            "Geoffreys shirt was lost between it being cut off by paramedics and the Detectives arriving at the scene later, his family believe that it may have had some evidence to either support or disprove the police version of events.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Ford Escape was an advanced SUV for the time and contained a crash data recorder, unfortunately this had failed to activate or had been erased shortly after the incident and couldnt be used in the case. Geoffreys family believe the vehicle was mishandled in the aftermath of the incident leading to the loss of crucial evidence.\n",
            "\n",
            "DNA and fingerprint tests came back to a number of people but these were all eliminated as people who had rented the vehicle prior to Geoffrey and none could be linked to him beyond renting the same car.\n",
            "\n",
            "Photos of the scene that night showed impact dents in the back of the SUV that police indicated showed Geoffrey had been pinned by the vehicle to the hydrant but these photos have caused more problems due to the appearance of two dents on the rear which suggest a double impact with the Hydrant only accounting for one of the dents and the other dent being more oval and suggesting something was between the hydrant and SUV for this impact, likely this was Geoffrey. Some believe that the two dents suggest a sinister clue as it may suggest someone backed the vehicle into Geoffrey twice.\n",
            "\n",
            "The manner in which Geoffrey was hit by the SUV also caused more questions then answers, the impact mark on the SUV consistent with hitting him matched up with the bruise in the shape of the Hydrant on his back, this suggested however that he had been sitting against the hydrant at the time of the impact and like him getting out to walk back to the hydrant in the first place, why he would sit against it hasnt been satisfactorily answered.\n",
            "\n",
            "The police pointed to similar incidents of cars and SUV's rolling back or forward and pinning people by accident as an example of what may have happened to Geoffrey but his family have also pointed out that in the majority of these cases the individual can't free themselves.\n",

She decided to go home. She was tired. She told me she loved me and walked out of the door.\"\n",
            " \n",
            "Marlaquinta \"Marla\" Sheree McGhee's mother, Lakenya Twilley, last saw Marla around 6 p.m. on May 12, 2015.

The Charley Project notes that Marla dropped her sons off at her father's house and decided to go home after changing her mind about dinner. However, the news article begins by saying that Marla has not been seen since she dropped her sons off at their father's home and then discusses Marla meeting Lakenya for dinner. The Charley Project notes that Marla was last seen in the 3900 block of Ridgedale Street but it is unclear whether this is Lakenya's or the children's father's home.\n",

Accordingly, Lakenya contacted Marla on her phone several times but she never answered. Surveillance cameras capture Marla leaving her apartment on the morning of May 12 but I assume this is footage of her leaving her home initially during the day before meeting her mother and dropping off her children later in the day. \n",

Her car, a tan/brown 1999 Ford Contour with tape on the driver's side window and the Tennessee license plate number 302ZTG, has not been found and she has not used her EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card since her disappearance. \n",

            "The Murder of Amanda Clairmont\n",
            "\n",
            "Amanda Clairmont was a 21-year-old student at the University of North Texas (UNT), studying business (some outlets say religious studies) while also pursuing her passion for make-up. She was a senior at UNT, and had worked at a makeup counter in Nordstrom at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco since she was 18. \n",
            "\n",
            "Clairmont had moved to Texas in 2007, joining other family members in Texas following her mother's death. She first lived in McKinney, before settling in Frisco, and attended Liberty High School, where she was considered to be pretty popular among her peers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clairmont enrolled at UNT in 2014, following her graduation from high school. Her most recent address according to public records is in Denton, but a friend stated that she was living in Corinth at the time of her murder. \n",
            "\n",
            "Two weeks before she was found murdered, she had created a new Instagram account to showcase her make-up artistry abilities. Her half-brother Mike Gawlik said \"she loved helping people with hair and just anything to help someone feel good about themselves.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "On the night of her murder, Gawlik said he learned from friends that Clairmont had been out drinking in the Fry Street bar area. This is a popular area with UNT students. Another witness said that Clairmont was with at least one person at the time. However, Gawlik stated that Clairmont was not a heavy-drinker and did not use drugs. This is possibly the last time she was seen. \n",
            "\n",
            "In the early hours of November 19th, 2017, Clairmont's body was found during a patrol near Church Drive and the Interstate 35E service road in Corinth. The car headlights were on, and the passenger door was open. The car was \"parked against the fence,\" but some news outlets report the car as crashed into the fence. \n",
            "\n",
            "The parking lot where she was found borders a Nissan dealership, and a few houses. A nearby resident stated that she heard several gunshots in the area between midnight and 1am, but did not hear any vehicles speeding out of the area. The amount of gunshot wounds that Clairmont had has not been revealed, as the Corinth PD states this is a critical piece of the investigation. Likewise, they have not released the type of vehicle that she was found in. \n",
            "\n",
            "The Corinth PD insists that this is not a cold case, and that it is an isolated incident. Clairmont's death is also the first homicide to be investigated by the Corinth PD in 17 years. Very few details have been released in the nearly three years since her death.

Authorities believe the  child's mother attempted to smother her and then threw her off the  eastbound Interstate 10 bridge before committing suicide. This theory is  supported by the fact that only two days before the discovery of the  child's body, a seemingly upset woman wearing a blue plaid shirt and  jeans and holding a baby around Delta Dawn's estimated age was seen  walking on Mississippi State Highway 63 and, later, the National  Interstate 10. The woman repeatedly refused help from those who drove by  and offered assistance. This incidence occurred on December 3rd, 1982.\n",

An autopsy revealed  that the girl had been smothered and then thrown into the river whilst  still alive, where she drowned. In 2009, Delta Dawn's body was exhumed  and DNA was collected. To date, there have been no matches to the DNA  sample and Delta Dawn, and the woman in the blue plaid shirt, remain  unidentified.\n",

            "Trenton, Michigan is a small city of less than 20,000 people, sitting along the western bank of the Detroit River, south of the city of Detroit. It’s home to many industrial facilities, such as the Chrysler Engine Plant and McLouth Steel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Within these city boundaries, 16 year old Amaria Hall lived with her mother, April. She was a junior at Carlson High School, involved in extra-curriculars as varied from robotics to volleyball. She was a good student, but suffered from some health issues, including asthma, a bone disorder, anxiety, and depression that caused her to miss classes for long periods of time. Because of this, in the summer of 2019, she was working online to catch up so she could go to college and become a social worker.\n",
            "\n",
            "On top of her schoolwork, Amaria was active on social media and other forums. She met a variety of people this way. During this summer, a package arrived for Amaria from a man she had met on one of these sites.\n",
            "\n",
            "On July 6th, Amaria approached her mother and said she couldn’t get online without an adaptor for her computer. They tried to find it, but with no luck. April agreed to take her shopping, but wanted to take a nap. \n",
            "\n",
            "While the Charley Project page says there was an argument about the adaptor, interviews with April say there was no argument, and barely even a disagreement. According to April, her daughter seemed a little depressed, but no harsh words were exchanged, and the plan was to go shopping for a new one.\n",
            "\n",
            "Either way, Amaria ended up using her mom’s phone’s hotspot to get online.\n",
            "\n",
            "Around 3:00am on Sunday, July 7th, 2019, April heard the sliding glass door of the Hall’s home open. Trenton is a very low-crime city, so April gave this little thought and fell quickly back to sleep. A few hours later, she was getting ready for church and went to wake Amaria up. That’s when she noticed Amaria was missing.\n",
            "\n",
            "A note from Amaria was sitting on the kitchen table. In the note, Amaria said she had run away. It directed April not to look for her, and that doing so would just make it worse. Amaria had packed clothes and a pair of sandals, but did not take any of her much needed medication, or her inhaler.\n",
            "\n",
            "April immediately called her family and friends and set out to look for her daughter. Trenton police became involved, and the city was scoured. Tips came in from Westland and Warren, both cities in the greater Detroit area, as well as the east side of Detroit. Nothing came of these leads, though April and the Hall family and their friends continued looking.\n",
            "\n",
            "In August of 2019, almost exactly one month after Amaria’s disappearance, April received a phone call. It was Amaria. The teen said she wanted to come home, but was being prevented from doing so. She said she would only be allowed to come home if April said a certain person had not taken her. The line went dead before the family could respond.\n",
            "\n",
            "Amaria has not been seen or heard from since. Leads from Detroit, Michigan to Key West, Florida, and as far west as Minnesota have come in, though nothing has turned anything up. April Hall believes her daughter was trafficked, and refuses to give up looking.\n",
            "\n",
            "The man who sent the package is being eyed as involved in the case. Details on the package or the sender are scarce, but he is believed to be in his 40s. He has sent multiple location tips to the FBI, which only furthers this theory. April Hall believes this man lured her daughter away from home, and even possibly used force.\n",
            "\n",
            "April refers to the man as the “Romeo Pimp.” Amaria’s grandfather had passed away shortly before the conversations with this man began happening. She believes Amaria was more vulnerable than usual because the death exacerbated Amaria’s depression, and the man took advantage of that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Amaria is described as 5’6” tall and weighting approximately 150lbs. Her mother says she had been losing weight. Her nose and her ears are pieced, and she wears braces. There is a reward being offered for information that could lead to finding Amaria. It is unfortunately not known what she was wearing.\n",

When he turned his head to complete a task, he continued to talk to Chris.  When he had no response after a minute, he looked back and saw no sign of Chris. At first he though maybe he stepped away to use the bathroom in the woods, but he called out several times with no answer. Finally, he summoned the other guys and they walked down to look for him.  \n",

            "Jeanifer Shyan Weldon was last seen on September 19, 1987, walking northbound along US Highway 98 towards Daughtery Road, less than three miles from her home in Lakeland, Florida. She was walking home alone from a friends house after going to a nearby carnival earlier that evening. Jeanifer was last seen with a neon green backpack.  \n",
            "\n",
            "On the afternoon of Sept. 19, Jeanifer called her little sister, Amy, and asked her to come meet her at her friends’ house. Amy got upset with Jeanifer because she was grounded and was not supposed to be out with friends. The two argued and Jeanifer told Amy  that she was going to the carnival later, then hung up on her. When Amy called the friend back, Jeanifer would not speak to her. The friend told Amy that her and Jeanifer would be walking back to her house after the carnival, and Amy told her to call her when Jeanifer began walking home so she could meet her halfway.\n",
            "\n",
            "At around 8:30 p.m., Jeanifer’s friend called the Weldon’s home phone and asked Amy if Jeanifer had made it home okay. Distraught because she was supposed to call her when they parted ways, Amy put the family’s German Shepard on a leash, left a note for her mother and walked south from her home on North Socrum Loop Road towards the path on Daughtery Road where she expected to see Jeanifer walking. Several hours passed, but she never came home. Jeanifer’s mother, Alice, later joined in the search when she got home from work.  The next day, several of Jeanifer’s friends joined Amy and Alice to help distribute fliers around the Lakeland Shoppes strip mall. \n",
            "\n",
            "After she disappeared, there were theories that 14-year-old Jeanifer, who was described in the local newspaper as looking “older for her age”, possibly met someone at the carnival and made plans to meet back up with them after leaving her friends house. There were also local rumors that Jeanifer ran away and got married shortly before she was murdered. None of these theories have ever been confirmed and Jeanifer was never considered a runaway. \n",
            "\n",
            "Three weeks later on October 2, Jeanifer Weldon’s decomposing body was discovered on a dirt road in Polk county, about 25 miles south of where she was last seen walking home. Her nude body was found on a remote, isolated stretch of land along Old Bowling Green Road near Fort Meade, FL. She was identified by undisclosed items found with some clothes left near her body, presumed to be hers. Although her body was too decomposed to determine a cause of death, the hyoid bone had been broken, an indication of strangulation. There was also evidence of sexual assault and several broken ribs. The lime green backpack she was last seen with was not found and has never been recovered.\n",

            "**The Suspect**\n",
            "\n",
            "When Jeanifer went missing, James Duckett, a 30-year-old ex-police officer, was living in Polk county. Duckett was the main suspect in the May 1987 murder and rape of an 11-year-old schoolgirl named Teresa McAbee while working on duty as a rookie police officer in the small town of Mascotte. In June 1988, he was convicted of first degree murder and sexual battery, and was sentenced to death. He is currently an inmate on Florida’s death row. (Teresa’s case is a particularly tragic one as well and a roller coaster; it was featured on a 2014 episode of CNN’s *”Death Row Stories”*. I won’t get into the details too much here but [this is a good write up about the case ](https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/4eyuf4/no_innocent_man_would_try_so_hard_to_have_his/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and all of the drama surrounding it.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Duckett was fired from the Mascotte Police Department in June 1987 and was indicted for Teresa’s murder that October. While awaiting trial, Duckett moved his family to a mobile home in Polk county during the summer of 1987. He was briefly employed as a night-shift laborer at a phosphate mine during the summer and fall of 1987 before being indicted in October. The Gardiner Mine where Duckett was employed at owned the remote land in Fort Meade where Jeanifer’s body was discovered. This area was about two miles from the Duckett’s mobile home. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the evening of Sept. 19, a dated time stamped gas receipt put Duckett around the Shadow Drive area in Lakeland where Jeanifer was last seen. There was also evidence he was in the vicinity of the carnival earlier that evening, and he would have taken Highway 98 as the route to get to his job. Duckett was scheduled to work at the phosphate mine at 11:00 p.m. on Sept. 19, however, he did not show up for work until around 1:00 a.m. on Sept. 20. According to his supervisor, Duckett acted disheveled and agitated during his shift. \n",
            "\n",
            "More circumstantial evidence against Duckett was brought to police a year later when his wife, Carla, contacted the Polk County Sheriff’s Department. Carla claims that around the time of Jeanifer’s disappearance, Duckett came home one morning with a neon green bag with a stuffed animal inside for their children. Carla stated that she only remembered this because they had two sons, and she was irritated with James for only bringing home one toy, since their sons would “just fight over it”. Carla and James Duckett divorced shortly after he was convicted of Teresa’s murder. Both the bag and the stuffed animal inside were thrown away sometime after his conviction. \n",
            "\n",
            "Duckett also had a long history of sexual harassment accusations prior to the murders, although he was never charged. While working as a rookie officer, Duckett was accused by three young women, aged 15-18, of sexually harassing them and using his authority as an officer inappropriately to lure them into his patrol vehicle. One of these alleged assaults happened in an abandoned trailer near Fort Meade, not far from where Jeanifer’s body would be discovered years later. When asked if Duckett would be capable of hurting somebody, the victim said, “yeah, absolutely. Especially one that young.” (referring to Teresa, who was 11) \n",
            "Duckett denies all assault allegations and maintains his innocence in the murder of Teresa McAbee. He also denies any involvement in Jeanifer Weldon’s murder. \n",
            "\n",
            "James Duckett has never been charged with the murder of Jeanifer Weldon. Because he is already on death row for murdering Teresa McAbee, and because the evidence against him remains circumstantial, it is unlikely that the Polk County Sheriff’s Department will charge him with Jeanifer’s murder. Law enforcement has never named another suspect or person of interest in the case.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jeanifer was about turned 15 on September 22, 1987. She was a tenth grader at Lake Gibson High School and played on the girls softball team. She loved music, softball, going to the beach, makeup, shopping and spending time with her friends and sister. \n",

Research into the murder quickly hit a wall as investigative techniques at the time were unable to recover much in the way of physical evidence. However a article in the New York based Poughkeepsie Journal references the Cheney murder and its similarities to the murder of Army Nursing Cadet Lucille Elizabeth Lawrence in Poughkeepsie, New York on October 27 1943. It then turned into a number of articles all featuring Women killed in the MidWest and East Coast all within a year of each other. Each was ambushed out of the dark and murdered in a vacant lot. Possible that each is the work of the same killer ? Upon finding additional similar cases with convictions, it seems police may have been quick to convict those who had been committed to institutions.\n",

            "- At around 5 p.m. Oct. 6, 1943, 10-year-old Val Hill was searching a brush-covered area for sumac leaves near her home at 1202 W. Sioux St. when she happened upon the lifeless body of Army 2nd Lieut. Naomi Cheney. Cheney ate at the officers club at 6 p.m. Oct. 5. She was there to visit her roommate, who was in the hospital on the base. She left the airbase at 9 that evening through gate No. 3, which opened out onto Northwest (now Burnside), where it crosses Western Avenue. She asked the guard if walking home would be safe, and he told her, “Use your own judgement.” She was seen a short way down the road by a cab driver, who mentioned to the guard that he had seen her at the corner of Northwest and Sixth Street. The walk home would have taken around 25 minutes, depending on conditions. Cheney's body was found southwest of the Omaha viaduct, which was what they called the West 12th Street bridge that crosses over the train tracks west of Grange Avenue. This was a little over three blocks from her home. She lay on her back, her uniform intact but somewhat rumpled. Her purse was propped against a nearby boulder, her visor cap a short distance away and her flight cap across her chest. The WAC insignia from her left collar tip was found a foot from her body. Her shoe was scuffed on two sides and the toe crushed, as though her foot had been stepped on. Her face was bloody on one side, and blood had pooled near her head. An autopsy performed during the night by army and civilian doctors disclosed a multiple fracture of the right side of the skull and brain hemorrhages, believed to have resulted from a \"tremendous blow with a rock or other heavy instrument.\" The examiners reported \"no evidence of rape,\" but army officers said Miss Cheney, a second lieutenant, died under \"suspicious circumstances.\" They said they were \"wholly without clues.\" \"The doctors estimate that she was slain between 11 o'clock and midnight Monday,\" Lt. Evans said. \"It was about 18 hours before her body was found. There was blood on her face and signs of a crushing blow on the head.\" She had eaten Peas before her death, however the hospital she had visited did not have peas on its menu.\n",

            " - Suspect: On Oct. 6, a 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. Police picked him up downtown as he was preparing to leave town. His name has never been released. He was described as medium build, fairly good looking, with wavy hair and a small mustache. He had a wife and kids in Iowa and had worked as a farm laborer near Worthington, Minn., before coming to Sioux Falls. He was rumored to have at least one girlfriend in town. He had been staying in one of the cabins at Smith’s Auto Court, currently the Nites Inn. The police found blood on his shoe and blood-matted hair near and inside his cabin, neither of which he could explain. He suggested that the blood on his shoe could have come from grass he was walking through, though the blood was not found on the bottom of his shoe. The Argus leader Paper states that a witness two blocks south told police she heard a scream and rustling noises. Soon after the transient was seen stumbling out of the cabin, where he vomited outside. In between the murder and the mans arrest, he made no attempts in the hours between to remove bloody evidence from his cabin or clothing. The police worked to bring Cheney’s killer to justice, but the evidence was not conclusive. Blood and hair samples were sent to the FBI in Washington, D.C., but the samples were not good enough for the forensics of the day. In addition, the man in question was set to be inducted into the Army, and at the time the war effort might have been more important to the military than justice. He was released Oct. 27. He was later killed in WW2. The case remains unsolved.\n",

The attractive Hospital nurse cadet spent the last hours of her tragically shortened life in the company of Ellen G Owen, a stenographer and secretary. “We met at Nixon and Market,” she said nervously. “We went to the late Stratford where we saw two pictures.” Ellen said that at about 9 o’clock after the show she and Lucille went to the Hotel Campell on invitation to attend the Lions Club’s “Hobo” party and left there at about 9:45 to go to Miss Owen’s home. “I knew mother ‘d be worrying and I wanted to let her know we were alright” She explained. Then, Ms Owens said, she and Lucille returned to Campbell and had a few dances until about 20 minutes to 12”. Upon leaving the Campbell Lucille and Miss Owens walked as far as Tiffanys before parting ways. “Lucille wanted at first to get a Taxi, but she didn't have enough money” “I said ‘I think I have some’ but she said ‘nevermind, I think I can run down”. “I let her take my coat because she only had on only a light dress. The last I saw of her she was running down by doctor Ryders, carrying her umbrella.” “I wanted Lucille to stay all night at my home, but she was on late leave and had to be back at the Hospital by 12 o’clock.

Creighton was waiting in a car for his wife to finish work at the hospital, he told police. Another anonymous description given to police that night was that of a “youth aged 20 to 25 years of age, five feet nine, with black hair and a Foreign Extraction.” Police rounded up many suspects but none were proven to have a connection with the case.\n",

            "- Butler walked into a New York City police station in early December. Butler approached a traffic officer at 34th Street and 7th Ave. He told him that he wanted to see Detectives Sullivan and Swander. “The officer called Patrolman James Fountain and the defendant told him that he was from Poughkeepsie where he had murdered a girl and that he wanted to talk to Sullivan and Swander. The Patrolman took him to take the defendant to west 20th street station house and took him to the detectives room and to Sullivan and Swander.” “The defendant told Detectives Sullivan and Swander that he wanted to tell them about the murder of the girl in Poughkeepsie. The defendant had been questioned here by two New York Detectives a week or so after the crime was discovered. The defendant was questioned by Sullivan and Swander and he admitted to them that he committed the murder and he told them how he commited the crime. We returned Sunday morning and Sunday evening accompanied by police officers, we went to the scene of the crime with the defendant. The defendant then re-enacted the crime in detail ... the second time we went to the scene was after midnight yesterday. The defendant admits he left his home in the neighborhood of the scene of the crime (16 Reade Place) and he walked to the Vassar Hospital where he hid himself in a stonewall. The Lawrence girl happened to be the first to appear in the street and he assaulted her with a rock. The girl ran ahead and he chased her down and assaulted her with the rocks and stones.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The Poughkeepsie Journal writes on December 14th 1943 “Authorities admitted today that a ‘sexula motive’ precipitated the crime. Butler, it was said, confessed to New York detectives Saturday that the killing of the girl was ‘worrying him’ and he couldn't stand it any longer. Butler then repeated his confession for local authorities. He told them numerous incidents that were not previously made public but which authorities admitted were accurate and directly connected with the crime. Butler it was said pointed to the opening in the stone wall where he hid until Miss Lawrence approached him. He pointed out the spot where he picked up the stones and rocks, which he used in the bludgeoning of the face and head of the girl. He led authorities to the wooded spot where he finally left the body of the girl, and he walked through the lot and bushes explaining that that was the course he took as he pursued the girl as she ran and fought for her life.” The defendant appeared nervous as he talked with detectives after midnight. He carefully explained the course he took as he followed the girl. He told of where he threw the rocks after killing the girl. His accounts of the slaying were accurate and in detail. In a statement given by Police Chief Leadbitter, Detectives George Swander and Daniel Sullivan, and other local authorities regarding the finding of the case “It is conceded that he is a paroled patient from an insane institution and it is my opinion reinforced by psychiatrists, that he was insane at the time and still is.”\n",
            "\n",
            "On the day the girl's body was found both the New York Times and the Poughkeepsie Journal quote Dr Howard P Carpenter deputy county medical examiner cautioned authorities to hasten the apprehension of the killer. He said “The girl was killed by an insane person, a crazy person. And he warned that unless an early arrest was made other victims might be found”. Did they race to a conclusion due to the public pressure to apprehend a killer ? I think there's a definite possibility.\n",

            "- When cross exclaimed during his trial Bernard’s defence counsel asked detective Sullivan “Is it a fact that the boy's first statement to you in New York was ‘I think I killed the Girl’. Sullivan answered “That was the substance of his remarks”. Mr Mulvey was assigned to defend Bernard and quickly look to pick apart Bernards re enactment. Mr Mulvey pointed out that Bernards re re-enactment of the crime disclosed several discrepancies in that he said in the confession in New York that he hit the girl with stone, however Butler selected a brick as a weapon when taking part in the re-enactment. There were further differences as to the girls as to the girls action in the lot as Bernard said on one occasion he pushed the girl up the hill, on another occasion he said she stumbled up after the attack, and on a third time he said she ran up. Sullivan agreed that these varied accounts were given. Asking if he maintained any check on the youth after questioning him initially on November 16th, Sullivan replied “no”. When asked if he questioned Butler as to what happened to Miss Lawrence's Purse Sullivan said he asked the boy when he talked to him in the anteroom of the jail on December 13th. “Bernard replied”, Sullivan said “I have told you everything else, and I would tell you that if I knew” Asked if he knew when Butler became convinced he committed the murder, Sullivan replied “no”. Mulvey then asked “Did anyone ask him if he had been at the scene of the crime, if he had seen the stakes there and gained his knowledge there ? Sullivan replied that he had not asked these questions and was not aware if these questions had ever been asked. Sullivan described Butler's emotions during the confession as “there were times when he was normal and other times when he would flare up”. Switching to his final flaw with the re-enactment Mulvey asked Sullivan “Did the boy point to the back porch and say “That's the porch where I think I came out of that night. I came out and stood here. I don't know from then. I walked in a Daze.” Sullivan replied that “Yes, such remarks were made by the boy” Upon his initial inspection and interrogation on November 16th, no blood was found present on Bernard. On December 11th Sullivan personally searched Bernard's clothing for blood, but none was found. Later Bernard's clothes were gathered from his residence. No blood was found.\n",

After arriving home they put the car away at around 11. He said he had something to eat with his mother and sister in the kitchen, that when he went into the bedroom off the kitchen that he shared with his dad and brother, the accused was asleep. He said he awoke at about 7:15 the next morning and found Bernard in the Kitchen. Butler's sister Mary says that Bernard went to sleep at around 8:15pm. He was there when she left to pick up Joseph at 10:30 and he was there when they arrived home at 11. Ms Butler related that Bernard read the papers in great detail when concerning the paper. She recalled that her “son exhibited an un usual interest in the murder when he learned about it. That the morning of the murder Bernard had gone outside after breakfast and talked to the boy next door. The boy told Bernard about the finding of the body and details he had heard around town that morning. The boy then asked Bernard if he would like to go see the body, he replied that he “did not”. Bernard’s mother said she had her son committed to Hudson River about 11 years ago as he would wander away. She replied that he had wandered away to either Albany or New York City nearly 15 times. She said after being boarded about on May 24th of the previous year, Ms Butler admitted that Bernard had wandered away twice that summer for long stretches of time.\n",

So I went home and went back to bed.” Bernard makes no mention of any screaming.

Ridings in Room 729.Ridings, 32, was a physical therapist in the Women's Army Corps, stationed at Camp Atterbury. That Saturday night, she was on leave and was to have had a date. Early news accounts described \"her half-nude, ravished and slashed body;\" later stories said she was clothed in \"a slip, regulation WAC shirt, skirt and stockings.\" She had been beaten and slashed; a large pool of blood was near her head. A broken whiskey bottle was found in the room and was presumed to be the murder weapon. Police determined she had bought the bottle herself. At About 6:30 p.m., Cpl. Emanuel Fisher, also stationed at Camp Atterbury, called Ridings' room from the Claypool's lobby. There was no answer, he later told police. Within days, police were looking for a \"dark-haired woman in black\" who was seen with Ridings in the room about three hours before the body was found. A bellboy briefly was arrested or detained for questioning, thousands of leads were checked, but the case never was solved. It was known as \"The WAC Murder\" and was considered one of the city's most notorious murders for decades.\n",

This murder takes place just a few months before the Cheney and Lawrence murders. It shares a number of similarities to our previous murders in New York and South Dakota. Furthermore a case involving Ms Agda Moline of Omaha who was killed on January 9th 1944 is connected to the murder of Ms. Weatherill. At one point the police looked at the same man for each crime. We will look at each crime due to their similarities as well.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Pearl May Weatherill, 27 and mother of three, vanished shortly after leaving a dance hall and was found slain five hours later in an empty lot. A doctors examination disclosed that Mrs. Weatherill had been strangled and said that her clothing had been badly torn and injuries on her throat indicated that she struggled fiercely with her assailant before being overpowered. The body was discovered about 75 feet from the sidewalk by her husband Nyal and his brother James after they had been searching for her.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The dancing group ( Nyal and Rearl Weatherill, Al Goodman and his Lucille and Pearls 18 year old niece Mary) reached the Council Bluffs club at around 10 oclock. The group immediately ordered soft drinks which the men quickly spiked with whisky and rum. The group toasted “Every man to his own poison” before each quickly downing a drink in celebration. Pearl had 5 drinks while Nyal consumed 7. The orchestra began to play and Al Goodman whisked Pearl Weatherill out onto the dance floor. Nyal’s eyes followed the couple throughout the song. As the music broke and the duo returned to their seats Nyal grabbed his wife and hurried her back out onto the dance floor. She asked him what was the matter and he replied “You and Al danced pretty close together that time”. “Nye, you shouldnt be jealous that way!” responded Pearl. The rest of the night proceeded on uneventfully however there was a hint of awkwardness in the air. This was not the first time Nyal had shown his jealous side nor was it the first time Pearl had attracted male admiration. She used to tell Nyal “I just can't help it if men find me attractive”. At About 1 am the group prepared to leave. As the women walked by the adjoining table a young man looked intently at Ms Weatherill and Ms Goodman, and quibbed loudly “There are sure some good looking women”. The girls laughed off the comment while Nyal bristled. “You want to make something of it ? one of those women is my wife” “Nyal !” Pearl exclaimed. “Don't cause any trouble”. Pearl ran out of the club in tears, her friend and niece right behind her. Al stayed inside to calm down Nyal and to de-escalate the situation. A few minutes later Lucille suggested that the trio should return inside and leave with the men. “Let's go back inside and get the men,” Lucille suggested. “No!” said Pearl who was steaming with anger at the behavior of her husband. They walked a block. Pearl staring straight ahead and the others glancing around anxiously. Pearl suddenly said “You go on back and I’ll go on alone”. “No honey you can't do that” replied Lucille. “Oh yes I can, I'll be alright. If I go back it will be the same thing all over again.” Pearl argued back. “Maybe this will teach Nyal a lesson if I let him come after me for once !”. Without another word she broke into a run down the dark street. Lucille and Mary, frightened by Pearl's outburst, ran back to the club to fetch Nyal and Al. The group jumped into the car and returned home. They figured that Pearl may have run home as she had offered up the idea that the group should walk to the club earlier in the night, however her idea had been vetoed and the group drove. In a few minutes the car was back in the Weatherill driveway, however there was no sign of Pearl. The group drove the mile between the club and the home 5 times before Al returned home to acquire his car in order to expand the amount of ground the group could search. (It was later estimated that the group passed the area of Pearls murder at least a dozen times during their search). The women suggested she may have passed out due to the alcohol consumption combined with a night of dancing and running. At 4:55 am the group decided to head to the police station.\n",
            " \n",
            " They had assumed Pearl had been either more distraught then they had realized and looked to really scare her husband, or that maybe she had suffered some kind of medical emergency. Not wanting to embarrass his wife or tarnish her reputation he asked the police officers on duty to be subtle in their handling of the search for his wife. The Goodmans and Mary returned to bed expecting Pearl to be found with a reasonable explanation. Nyal however was distraught and continued his search. Looking for help he went to the home of his brother James. James awoke and told his brother he knew nothing of Pearl and agreed to help. It was nearly 6am when James would exclaim “There she is”. A bit of white had been seen back 75 feet from the sidewalk. At first the men thought she had simply passed out, however upon closer inspection it was apparent she had been brutally murdered. Pearls long sleeve white satin sports blouse was torn open and pulled down from her shoulders. Her stocking and garter belt were down to her ankles, her skirt up to her waist. Twigs and leaves were clinging to Pearl's torso. Cinders were embedded in her flesh. Pearl's face was lavender in color from what doctors described as “pinpoint hemorrhage” caused by suffocation. There were bruises on both hands and scratches on her thighs. The brothers carried her body to the car. They hoped if they got her to the Hospital on time they would be able to save her. However Pearl May Weatherill was announced dead on arrival. Doctors said Pearl had died from strangulation between 2 and 5 hours before.\n",
            "\n",
            "- 78 feet from where the body was found police found Pearls items neatly arranged. There were her new brown oxfords tucked one inside the other. There were her step-ins stained with blood. Beside her pocketbook was a rose colored pendant and necklace. A troop of boy scouts had been sleeping only 150-200 yards away from where her body had been found that night, yet no one heard anything.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Three months went by then police caught a ‘break’ in the case. Dwight Bender, an agent in the Iowa Investigative Bureau was assigned the case. He read over the testimonies of vagrants found in the area, he then compared that list with those who had committed crimes.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Harry E May 23, was arrested four days after Pearl's death on the charge of choking a small boy and being a “peeping” tom. May had been sent to St. Bernards Hospital for observation and then subsequently was held as insane. Following the report that he was insane Iowa declared Harry Minnesota’s problem because he had only been visiting Iowa to visit his brother Philip. Philip then promised to take Harry back to Minnisota. However Philip only took Harry as far as the main highway and gave him instructions to hitchhike home. Harry had never made it home. This made it very difficult for Detective Bender to track him down. Two months later Bender received a tip that Harry had been working in Minneapolis as a Hotel Porter. Upon Bender's arrival at the Hotel of Harry's employment, he was told that Harry had recently been fired. Harry had been let go due to his tendency to looking insistently at the hotel's women. Within hours Bender tracked down May.\n",

            " - “A shambling open mouthed, empty headed young man Harry proved to be servile in his eagerness to please the nice important men from Iowa who had come all this way to see him”. Harry then licked his lips. He confessed to not only the murder of Pearl May Weatherill but several other women. The next hours were described as “crazy” by investigators. At one moment May, slowed by his speech impediment, would confess to all. At the next he would deny everything. Sometimes he would utter to himself over and over “Never heard of Harry May”. It was then May told investigators the story of how he killed Pearl. “On the night of May 13th I went to a picture show in Council Bluffs and then visited the nightclub. After 1 am I lay down in the grass of the vacant lot, just thinking about things - women and lights and music, and all kinds of nice things. I was wishing I had a cigarette then a woman passed me. I got up and asked for a cigarette and a match. I put my arms around her, still thinking nice things. She got away and I ran after her. I took hold of her hand, you know. She tried to slap my face. I had to tie a rope I found on the lot around her neck. Gee, her neck was soft and I was mighty careful. But her necklace and locket came off and I guess I jerked the rope too hard. We were near a little tree. She fell down. A mighty pretty flower fell out of her hair. She mumbled. I dragged her back to another tree. She couldn't talk so well by then. But she was strong and fought me. Most of her clothes were torn off. I tried to loosen the rope. Lots of automobiles went by. I was scared but I was nice and warm. May said he attacked Pearl again and all told spent about two hours with the Pearls body while her husband and friends repeatedly drove past and inspected the area. Harry took her pink rose as a keepsake. However when asked to present it later he said he got rid of it and could not give a reason as to why. However Harry did know two details that had not been released to the public. It was not told to anyone that Pearl had been strangled with a rope. Nyal had not been made aware of this detail as well however he had been able to obtain “credible” information that his wife had been raped. Furthermore investigators had not themselves been aware that Pearl herself had been wearing a Flower. A quick call to Nyal by investigators confirmed this detail.\n",

Identification of the victim was made by identification of the clothing by a daughter Mrs Violet McCreary of Omaha, who had earlier reported to police that her mother was missing. Mrs McCreary said her mother was returning home after visiting the McCreary home to see her grandson who was home on furlough from the Army, when the slaying occured. At about 8:30 pm Mrs McCreary said she took her son to the railroad station for his Army station, while a daughter named\n",

Dariene then returned to the railroad station to see her brother off, while Mrs Moline waited for the bus. Police believe Ms Moline boarded an east bound bus, left it at twentieth street, to catch a streetcar home. It was near Twentieth street that her body was found. Mrs McCreary said her mother had about $35 in her purse.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tellings of May’s exact confession can be difficult to tie down. Dates and times are changed. When it was asked how Harry became a suspect in the Moline case It is said it is because Harry admitted to it. In the Moline investigation Harry's confession is described a bit differently.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Bender said May had confessed to the entire crime after he had confided his affair with ‘a woman’ and described her in detail to Detective Carlson in a back room where Carlson had questioned him privately. He said May had told of meeting the women who started to run away but he threw a rope around her neck and dragged her back into the vacant lot. He testified that May said he attacked her and then dragged her back from the street into the corner of the vacant lot, away from the sidewalk and passing cars where he attacked her a second time. While he dragged her she kicked off her shoes as she struggled. The shoes which were introduced to evidence were still tied when found. When asked if she yelled, May said “Yes”, but that he pulled the rope around her neck tighter so that the screams were muffled.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Carlson who testified that Mays description of Ms Weatherills clothes, the incident with the rope, and the flower in her hair was the first he had heard of the details and he had taken May into a backroom and talked with him alone for approximately an hour and a half before he got the story of the first attack. He said he then called Bender and Jackson who came and heard the full story.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Harry would then confess to killing a Omaha woman. Under cross examination Bender repeated the testimony of Mays confession which he gave to Bender. Bender said May had told police that he had hit the woman in the head with a brick after she refused his advances near the Orpheum Theater in Omaha. Bender testified that May later repudiated that confession after inspector Fritz Franks of the Omaha police department informed him that the murder actually was commitied far away from the Orpheum. When asked why he had falsely confessed he said “it was just a crazy Idea”.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Before his trial May would shift back and forth between claiming responsibility for the murders and then denying he played any role.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Mrs Laura Murphy Mays sister, told of occasions when he had stayed in her home and she had been unable to sleep because of her fear of him. Ms Philip May, Harry's Sister in Law, Bender said, told that Harry was sitting on the running board of their car the morning of May 14th with no explanation.\n",
            " \n",
            " I think police may have fed Harry this story in order to close the case. Harry would be charged in the Weatherill case, however the Moline case remains unsolved. I believe Harry's lying in the Moline case, calls into question his credibility on the Weatherill confession.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The process in which information was either given or taken from Harry is a bit sketchy. It seems that police may have fed bits of information to Harry in order to solve the case. There were many private and backroom confessions.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Would a man of Harrys low IQ be able to pull of such a murder ? The murder was not planned. That means Harry found the rope during the struggle with a woman and figured out how to tie her up on the spot. He then was able to conceal the body and struggle from a search party and passer byers ?\n",
            "\n",
            "- He lied in the Moline case. If police did not force a confession then Harry could have just wanted to create an exciting narrative.\n",

            "Is there an undiscovered serial killer ? Not likely but it is interesting to look at the short time frame in which these murders occurred and how many followed the same pattern. A woman bludgeoned or strangled to death and then dragged into a vacant lot or alley. Robbery was never a confirmed motive and rape was never considered likely on any of the victims. If anything this write up will shed some light on a few unsolved murders that are rarely talked about. I do think it is interesting though to look at the two men who were accused. Bernard Butler and Harry May. Both men may have had their problems, but were they killers ? or were they pushed into a conviction and then whisked away to a hospital unable to fight their case.\n",

Schultz was gunned down and died without revealing where the treasure was buried, spawning a mystery that has endured for nearly a century. Now, 85 years later, three groups of treasure hunters, armed with modern technology and decades worth of intensive research, race to uncover new leads in hopes of finding Schultz’s missing treasure.\n",

            " \n",
            "\n",
            "On 11 August 1994, at about 10am, Lisa Masee used her husband Nick’s cell phone to make two calls. The first was to her employer, Yokoi Hair Salon, but there was no answer. The second was to Nick’s work, Turbodyne Technologies, where its principal Leon Nowek answered. Lisa told him that she and Nick would be away for a few days and would be back 16 August. She then tried the hair salon again and got the owner; she told him she had to deal with a court case and would be back on the 16th. That was the last anyone heard of them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nick Masee was a private banker with the Bank of Montreal. Most of his clients were wealthy and influential Vancouver Stock Exchange promoters. He had a reputation for being professional and discrete. In January 1994, after 35 years, Nick retired. As Nick and Lisa did each year, they then spent the month of February in Hawaii at their timeshare. Upon their return, Nick settled in with Turbodyne Technologies, finally working for one of the VSE companies he had represented in the past. \n",
            "\n",
            "Come April, Nick and Lisa made a secret trip to the Cayman Islands. Nick was usually very open with family about his travels and plans, but this time he did not tell anyone. Further, family had noticed he was not as open and somewhat secretive, which was out of character. While there, Nick opened up a company and a bank account, both of which were shut down about one year after they disappeared. Once they returned, they told family where they had been and that all was good.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sometime in June, someone called John Woods at Stockwatch, asking for Harry Moll’s banker, something to do with papers needing to be served. Harry Moll’s banker was Nick Masee. This same person called John Woods a few weeks later, again asking for Harry Moll’s banker, but this time stating he was representing a group of investors out of Chicago.\n",
            "\n",
            "August rolls around, and things get interesting. Nick receives a call in the first week from a man interested in investing $10M in Turbodyne. There is some speculation that this call was actually several days later, perhaps as late at 10 August. Regardless, Nick makes reservations at his favourite restaurant, Trader Vic’s, where the staff know him and Lisa by name, for 10 August at about 630pm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, Nick has been meeting with an old VSE colleague by the name of Don Shwery. He and Don were brokering an arms deal worth about $110M, and Nick would be the banker. Don meets with investigative journalist Terry Gould on 6 August to discuss the arms deal, which forms the basis of Gould’s article “Bank Error” written about one year later. On 9 August, Nick attends the funeral of Glen Hyatt, a well-known business and community leader; both Nick and Hyatt were BC Ballet benefactors. The funeral is at 2pm, is well-attended, and Nick is noticeably upset, according to newspaper reports. That same day at about 430pm, Don Shwery passes away unexpectedly of a heart attack. Shwery always had a briefcase with him, and it has been alleged that that briefcase held the documents regarding the arms deal. By about 7pm, many were aware that Shwery had passed and many were concerned with the whereabouts of that briefcase. \n",
            "\n",
            "On 10 August, Nick is contacted by the California investor asking if they can bring their wives. Nick calls Lisa at work. Nick then calls Trader Vic’s and changes the reservation to four. Lisa tells her colleagues at work about this mysterious investor. The California investor calls again, asking to reschedule for later that evening. Nick calls Trader Vic’s and reschedules for 8pm. No one shows for dinner. There was no call to cancel. \n",
            "\n",
            "So what happened? Several theories have been bandied about. Nick and Lisa disappeared themselves because they owed money, that someone was after them for a debt, or that Nick had embezzled money. Or Nick and Lisa were killed, for all the possible aforementioned reasons or for his knowledge in the arms deal. \n",

The three of them drive to the town of Saint-Hélène to the house of Olivier's mother (I have no indication where she was or if she even was till alive, maybe living in a retirement home) to gather fire wood for the winter. On that day both Olivier and Maud suffered from withdrawal symptoms. At the house of his mother they discovered that they had forgotten anti withdrawal medication (buprenorphine, a replacment opioid like methadone) and so Oliver drove back to fetch it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Acc. to Maud Robert tried to rape her when they were alone with each other. She used an axe handle to defend herself and fueled by her withdrawal symptoms she beat him dead. After that she collapsed.\n",

            "When Robert returned, he decided not to call the police as he assumed, they would not believe that the two of them, both convicted criminals, would have acted in self-defense, especially as there was no evidence for the attempted rape (e.g. torn clothes or bruises). So, they decide to cover up the death. They take the body outside and build a pyre.\n",
            "\n",
            "While trying to accelerate the fire with gasoline Olivier suffers major burns. While the body is still burning on the pyre the couple leave for the next emergency room. From there Olivier is flown with a helicopter to the center for burn treatment in Metz. He released himself the same night and the couple heads back to Saint-Hélène, where they discover that large parts of the corpse did not burn down.\n",
            "\n",
            "They start a new fire and keep it burning till no traces of the body remain. Meanwhile they clean the house to remove any traces that Robert was ever there. Olivier even plasters the joints between the flagstones to cover up blood splatters. They also rearranged the furniture and lacquered it. They also burned the axe handle and the clothes they used for cleaning.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the fire has burned down, they dig up the ground beneath it, cover the hole with new earth and dispose of the collected earth and ashes in a river in 20 km distance.\n",

            "To cover up his disappearance they spread the story that Robert went on a vacation in Cannes. They used his bank card to withdrawn money on ATMs in different places in France (e.g. the Vosges, Cannes and Paris). They also used his phone to send text messages to his friends regularly. For this they also drove every time to Cannes so that a possible geolocation of the mobile would show the correct location.\n",

Even with all the cleaning up the couple did, it should not be difficult for modern forensic science to find traces (e.g. blood traces). The forensic unit could only find faint traces of human blood under the new applied plaster but it was contaminated so badly by cleaning agents and the plaster that it could not be identified.\n",

            "\n",
            "The only part of the story the police could confirm were the burn wounds of Olivier. Later, during search of the couple's home they also find a trouser of Olivier that has a blood drop on it that can be traced back to Robert. But this is mighty thin for such a crime.\n",
            "\n",
            "To complicate things further Robert was indicted by a 15-year-old girl for sexual abuse a month before his death. Coupled with unconfirmed sightings of him in southern France, the police starts to believe that Robert might still be alive and this is all some kind of setup to get away from the charges. But they cannot find any traces of him.\n",

            "As they dig deeper, they find out that Robert and Olivier tried an insurance fraud in August of the same year by staging a robbery of Robert's house while he was in a hospital. That would have gotten them 50.000 euros of insurance money. As Olivier had a proxy to Robert's finances, he could have gotten the insurance money even if Robert was dead.\n",

            "As opposed to what was once generally thought, pharaoh Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten's royal wife Nefertiti probably wasn't Tutankhamun's mother according to DNA tests conducted on the mummies by Egyptologists at the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, in 2010. Instead, it was [identified](https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2010.121) that a mummy discovered in tomb [KV35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV35) is his mother and a mummy discovered in [KV55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV55) is his father. As of 2020, it is likely that the mummy of KV55 is Akhenaten (though there is opposition to this: [for instance](https://web.archive.org/web/20100307020356/http://www.kv64.info/2010/03/dna-shows-that-kv55-mummy-probably-not.html)), while the identity of the [Younger Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Younger_Lady) remains unknown, hence the informal nickname.\n",
            "\n",
            "Younger Lady's mummy was discovered in 1898 by Victor Loret, 24 years prior to discovering the well-known tomb chamber [KV62](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV62) of pharaoh Tutankhamun. She was found beside a young boy, approximately 10 years old, thought to be prince [Webensenu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webensenu), and an older woman identified to be Younger Lady's mother [Tiye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiye). All of these three mummies were extensively damaged by ancient tomb robbers. Younger Lady was found missing a part of her face and several teeth, a part of her ribcage, her right arm, a part of her pelvis, and the front halves of both feet. Due to her shaved head, Loret initially thought her to be a man. She was 1.58 m (5 ft 2) in height and 25 to 35 years old at the time of death.\n",
            "\n",
            "Interestingly, the damage to Younger Lady's face and jaw happened prior to her death [according to genetic test and CT scans](https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2010.121) and was lethal, instead of being done postmortem by, for instance, the grave robbers. This is thought because there were no signs that this injury would've been attempted to heal. Furthermore, the damage inclines that it came from a motion of something smashing her face in. This damage has been speculated to come from an axe blow or a horse kick during a chariot crash. The missing right arm [is thought](https://books.google.fi/books?hl=en&lr=&id=b4N9DAAAQBAJ) to have been found severed elsewhere within the tomb chamber as it resembles the intact left arm. This arm has also sustained some damage. Overall, the source of some of the damage to the mummy could not be identified.\n",
            "\n",
            "The identity of Younger Lady has been speculated for long. The DNA-identified family relation [makes it unlikely](https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2010.121) that Younger Lady was either Nefertiti or Akhenaten's secondary wife Kiya. Furthermore, it is unlikely that she was any of her father's royal wives Sitamun, Iset or Henuttaneb because Akhenaten didn't marry any of them. According to Hawass et al.'s 2010 study, it is likely that Younger Lady was either of the remaining two daughters of Amenhotep III that are known of, [Nebetah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebetah) or [Beketaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beketaten), because they didn't marry their father like their sisters.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, it is uncertain whether either Nebetah or especially Beketaten actually were Amenhotep III's daughters because only Sitamun, Iset, and Henuttaneb appear frequently on statues and reliefs of the time. Furthermore, Nebetah ceases to be mentioned after Amenhotep III's death which could mean that she died of an early age. Joyce (1999) suggests that Nebetah changed her name to Beketaten during Akhenaten's reforms since Beketaten was never mentioned before them, but there is no evidence of this. Also, Beketaten ceases to be mentioned after Tiye's death.\n",

None of the items found from Tutankhamun's tomb chamber depicted his mother despite of the fact that all of these items were well-documented and most of the items in his tomb weren't robbed prior to discovering the tomb in 1922. This is unusual in comparison to many other pharaoh mothers which are often depicted in historical evidence. If Younger Lady died prior to Tutankhamun's reign, it could explain this absence, although Tutankhamun's reign begun when he was only a child. Therefore, [it is likely](https://ixtheo.de/Record/1578328748) that Younger Lady was a minor wife of Akhenaten. Pharaohs of Egypt [typically had](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/2/100216-king-tut-malaria-bones-inbred-tutankhamun/) multiple wives.

            "Christopher \"Chris\" Lyn Holverson [DOB: 06/01/1979] was just shy of 19 years old in 1998. He was a 1997 graduate of Skyline High School in IF, and was working at a local Mexican restaurant at the time. He was known as an intelligent, kind soul. One friend mentioned on a blog that he did not care about her skin condition, which meant the world to her after years of being bullied for it. During this time person, Chris's parents were going through a divorce, and he was, understandably, upset about it, but did not appear resentful. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the night of May 17, 1998, Chris and several of his friends (7 teenagers, one adult) went camping at the Table Rock Campground in the Targhee National Forest. Chris left his Chevy pickup at the house of one of these friends. The weather was pretty rough that night- there was some snow on the ground, and sleet fell that night. At 6500 ft about sea level, the elevation is rather high. In spite of these conditions, the campground is reported to be well-used, not isolated, and wildlife is not known to descend upon campers. \n",
            "\n",
            "During this camping trip, the group that Chris was with \"partied\" that night. There are a lot of rumors about what this entailed, though one camper admitted to marijuana use. As a side note, his father (Terry) found drug paraphernalia in his bedroom shortly after his disappearance, but details about this find, and if it was tied to these events, are unknown. At some point, between 9:30pm and midnight, Chris left the tent. The campers claimed that he tripped over the rope, they teased him about it, and then he walked off. There are some claims that he got into a fight with one or more people he was with, while some said that he just left and that it was in his character to take off unannounced, but always returned.\n",

This sighting, again, was not confirmed to be Chris but LE believes that the sighting may be credible. There are mixed reports of when the campers realized that he was missing, as well as if they went to find him. His truck was still at the friend's house. Other than that, there has been no evidence about the whereabouts of him in the last 22 years. \n",

            "There are two main theories about the fate of Chris:\n",
            "\n",
            "1) He succumbed to the elements after walking off that night. There are several reasons why he could have walked off, but whatever the reason, something happened and he died. The weather was rough that night (sleet and snow), and Chris was only wearing a light jacket. It does not sound like he had a flashlight, either. However, most reports have said that this area was very easy to access, not isolated, and that wildlife encounters were rare. Perhaps he may have wandered too far, but this does not sound like a case him camping in some deep, difficult-to-navigate wooded area. Many locals say that it is VERY difficult to get lost. That being said, LE believes that the sighting of him by a vehicle is credible. \n",
            "\n",
            "2) Something happened at the campsite, and they have kept it a secret. It sounds like the campers initially told the same story, but it has possibly evolved in the years following. There are also some allegations about sketchy behaviors of the camping party in the days following his disappearance, but the details are not public knowledge. Now, no one has ever come forward and said, \"I think so-and-so killed Chris or \"xyz happened\" but the rumors run *rampant*. I have seen a loootttt of shit-slinging on certain Facebook groups between his family and friends and the people he camped with that night. Allegations of drug use (potentially stronger than weed), that the older adult (a step-parent of one of the teens in the group) threatened the others into silence, etc. The older adult in the group was alleged to have wanted to come forward with more information, but he passed away before he could. \n",

            "I stumbled upon some highly unusual pages on google's cache while searching for something related to the term vape. Two non-profits that I've found so far, have seemingly auto-generated text, complete with links, talking about different vaping products. None of the pages will display outside of Google's cache, but it doesn't say the page doesn't exist on the site's domain. The two I found are [chg.org](https://chg.org) and [snapwa.org](https://snapwa.org). If you search for these sites and \"vape tanks\" you can find 5-15 of these pages between the sites. The links in the text go to various vape product sites, and even loosely related products, like vicks vapor rubs. My best guess right now is this is some sort of \"attack\" where you embed these pages on google's cache in order to get a better rating for credibility. Since part of SEO, is how many times your links appear on other websites.\n",

            " \n",
            "Anne Bonny was a female pirate from the Golden Age of Piracy.  She is a name you will almost always find in just about any book on the subject, academic or otherwise.  A lot has been said and a lot has been written about her.  There are minor questions, such as when she was born or why she became a pirate.  But the most famous question, is what happened to her?  She vanished after a trial on November 28th, 1720, 300 years ago as of today.  Well since May I have been searching for an answer and I might have actually figured it out.  This story was published in the South Carolina Post and Courier today, and mostly draws from a 71 minute video I wrote for my YouTube channel.  The video and article are here but I have written a broad summary of the video if you would like to read it.  Sources are all listed at the end. \n",

            "Anne Bonny was a violent lesbian sailor.  Anne Bonny was a serial killer.  Anne Bonny was a feminist hero.  Anne Bonny was an inspirational LGBTQ icon.  Anne Bonny was a mere child who didn't think her life through.  Anne Bonny was a heroine of the people.  All of these phrases have been said by someone.  Historians, journalists, bloggers, all of these people saying something like this.  None of this is true.  She might be a famous icon of the Golden Age of Piracy, depicted in Black Flag, Black Sails, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and so on, but she isn't a well understood figure of history.  She was treated as more an oddity by contemporary writers, in the vain of a carnival barker saying come see the freaks.  She is a prism to the past, a cipher.  Everyone sees something in her that reflects what they believe.  So what is the truth?  Who was she and what happened to her?\n",
            "\n",
            "Its a difficult question to answer.  Documents are hard to find, mostly kept in libraries across the Americas and the West Indies.  Most come in the form of newspapers and short articles, a proclamation from a governor here and there, and court transcripts.  Anything written years later is already unreliable, and details that come from the 20th century onward is almost always nonsense.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The Golden Age of Piracy is difficult to define, everyone has a different opinion on when it began and ended.  I picked the longest timeframe, 1650 to 1730.  An era defined by Henry Morgan, Henry Every, William Kidd, Edward Thatch, and Bartholomew Roberts.  In this time period of legendary criminals came a woman named Anne Bonny.  Said to be from Ireland, bastard daughter of an attorney and a maid.  She moved to the Carolinas, lived a life that included stabbing a maid and almost killing a rapist, before running away with a sailor to Nassau, the Pirate Republic.  She falls in love with Jack Rackham, quartermaster for Charles Vane.  Rackham seizes power, Anne runs away from her husband and they plunder ship after ship.  Eventually Anne falls for a sailor who is really Mary Read, becoming close friends.  The British navy eventually captures them, Rackham is hanged but the two women avoid the noose by way of pregnancy.  Mary dies in prison but Anne is never seen again.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the story as told in Captain Charles Johnson's General History of the Pyrates.  Who was Captain Charles Johnson?  It was an alias, not his real name.  Almost certainly taken from the playwright Charles Johnson, who wrote a play about pirate Henry Every.  In the 1930s historians mostly agreed Johnson was Daniel Defoe, author of Robinson Crusoe.  In the 1980s the general opinion changed to Nathaniel Mist, Defoes publisher.  The popular suspect remains Mist, an opinion I agree with while fully admitting it could have been another writer under Mist.  The mystery of who Captain Charles Johnson is cannot be solved beyond reasonable doubt, and its not the only problem with the book.  Its full of claims without sources and when a source can be used to factcheck it, the facts don't add up.  The book takes a true story and almost always twists it for more dramatic events or details almost certainly made up.  Anne Bonny's story is the worst example, her chapter is mostly about her father's misunderstandings about silver spoons.  It has quotes that were never said at her trial.  It contradicts witness statements at the trial.  In a book full of lies, Anne Bonny's chapter is perhaps the worst of the bunch.\n",
            "\n",
            "So what is the truth?  Well, Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas first mentioned Anne in a proclamation recorded in the Boston Gazette.  He said the pirate John Rackam, notice the spelling difference, stole a sloop called the William from the harbor.  He did it with 14 people, 12 men and two women.  He lists them as Ann Fulford, alias Bonny, and Mary Read.  A key detail of Johnsons account is Mary dressing up as a man and not being discovered to be a woman until the trial.  This makes it all very unlikely.  There are some scattered papers of two female pirates on a sloop attacking fishing boats reported through September and October, no names are mentioned but we know who this is.  The big document is the Tryials of John Rackam and other Pyrates.  A pamphlet printed in Jamaica that functions like a transcript, its quite rare and very key to the story.    The pamphlet mentions that they robbed several fishing boats, sloops and schooners until October 22 1720.  On that day, Rackam was caught by the privateer Jonathan Barnet, who ironically had served as a pirate alongside Henry Jennings in 1715.  He caught the pirate after a pathetically short battle and brought them to Jamaica.  Rackam was hanged on the 18th.  Anne and Mary faced the court and governor of Jamaica, Sir Nicholas Lawes, on November 28th in the court house of Spanish Town.  Anne Bonny was called Ann Bonny, alias Bonn.  There several witnesses were brought forward, captains of vessels they stole, and witnesses to there crimes.  They described them as constantly swearing, giving powder to cannons, and boarding vessels with cutlass and pistols drawn.  They even tried to kill a female witness at one point.  They wore sailors regalia while plundering but dressed in womens clothing when off duty.  They were called spinsters of New Providence, and they never said a word to save themselves at trial.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end they were condemned to death not far from Henry Morgan's favorite town, Port Royal.  But before sentencing was done they claimed quick with child.  Following a newspaper in 1721 that referenced the trial and some other scattered reports, they were never heard from again.  \n",
            "\n",
            "So who was Anne Bonny?  Well I don't think she was Irish.  The name Anne is an English surname, it was popular due to Queen Anne of Great Britains reign but also well known due to Anne Boleyn.  The spelling of Anne or Ann also usually denoted social rank at the time.  Bonny is a French English name, it comes from the word bon, meaning good.  It was mostly associated with Lancashire County but popular in all of England.  Those other names, Fulford and Bonn, were also found in England and not Ireland.  Fulford was a popular surname in Staffordshire and Bonn is just a fancier spelling of the French word.  Nobody at her trial made mention of an accent or red hair, hell she probably had brown hair if she was from England.  \n",
            "\n",
            "She is perhaps the same Ann Bonny who was baptized in St. Giles In the Fields Church in St Giles London in 1690.  This Ann Bonny had several siblings and likely lived in St Giles, which was infamously a terrible place of poverty.  St Giles was also close to the Tyburn Tree and Execution Dock, so its possibly if this is Anne Bonny, she might have witnessed William Kidds death in 1701.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Its possible if this is the same woman, that she moved to Nassau around 1716.  1716 saw a rise in prostitution in Nassau and if Anne was an adult woman without a husband on that island, odds are likely she was a sex worker.  Mary Read was also likely a working girl.  In 1720 Governor Rogers started trying to stamp out prostitution because of his stern religious beliefs.  Around the same time he was doing this, was when Anne and Mary fled on the William.  Perhaps this was the cause of her short piracy career.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Now as to what happened to Anne, well there are many theories.  Perhaps she was executed after all, would contradict all the documents mentioning executions, so I doubt it.  I doubt she escaped that would have been quite a public sensation.  Many believe she escaped after her father paid for her release.  This is false, the name often used for her father is William Cormac.  This comes from the 1964 romance novel Mistress of the Seas by John Carlova.  He made up almost everything, even stealing details from the movie Anne of the Indies, but somehow historians ended up quoting this.  David Cordingly quoted it.  Colin Woodard quoted it.  Kate Williams quoted it.  It might be what shows up on Anne's wikipedia page but its not true.  We don't truly know who her parents were, I suspect they were probably just poor folk in England, nobody rich or powerful.\n",
            "\n",
            "This begs the question, where did she go?  Anne Bonny's fate is mysterious, Mary Read's isn't.  Everyone agrees she died in 1721, but no document is ever shown.  Sure some historians say there was a document, coming from a 1989 Clinton V Black book, but I couldn't find it on the internet.  The library of Jamaica flat out sent me listings for a childrens book but not a document.  I nearly gave up until I found a parish registry on a genealogy website.  Mary Read died in April of 1721, the document mentions a Mary Read Pirate buried April 28th.  It left me at a crossroads because I felt if there was no document for Mary, then maybe Anne died and nobody reported it.  As a joke I typed in Anne's name to the genealogy site.  By sheer luck I found a document listed as Ann Bonny, buried December 29th 1733, St Catherines Jamaica.  Its the right area, St Catherines is where Spanish Town is.  Its only 13 years after the trial, no family is listed and the spelling is without the phantom E Captain Charles Johnson added.  There are other Ann Bonny's buried in Jamaica but all are from either 1710 or a far off date like 1790.  \n",
            "\n",
            "If this is her, then what likely happened is, the Governor took pity on her and let her go.  There is a precedent, Mary Critchett, the only other female pirate convicted in the Golden Age, was never hanged and probably let go due to her gender.  If let go, Anne probably went back to prostitution, no paper trail or taxes or owning a house.  The child she had probably died or was taken, Jamaica was a rough place to live.  Its what probably killed her, disease like yellow fever or tuberculosis.  But she managed to outlive Governor Rogers, who died in 1732, and basically every notable pirate of the era.  If she could read, maybe she even read her own legend be born with General History.  Regardless, she is indeed a pirate legend, still going strong 300 years later and dare I say probably will remain popular in 300 more years.  \n",
            "\n",
            "She might be a legend now, but she was real once upon a time.  She perhaps lived an unremarkable life after a remarkable two month time period.  But its not what has been recorded, and it never will be.  When the legend becomes fact, print the legend, so says a John Ford classic.  Aye, a legend it may be and always be, but the truth can be learned if one looks hard enough.  Buried treasure may not be real, but finding the real story behind a nearly mythical woman is nearly as sweet.\n",

            "If you've been cruising Netflix in the past months due to whatever lockdown you have in your own country, you might have come across a docuseries called \"Carmel: who killed Maria Marta\" (in Spanish, \"Carmel: quien mató a María Marta\"). If you haven't, I strongly suggest you watch it, but here's a summary of the facts:\n",
            "\n",
            "On a rainy Sunday evening on October 27th of 2002 , in an upscale housing compound just a few miles outside Buenos Aires, Argentina, 50-year-old Maria Marta Carrascosa (neé Garcia Belsunce), rides her bike from her half sister's house in the same compound, to her own house, after a regular Sunday family gathering to watch a soccer match and have lunch. Maria's husband decides to stay with his in-laws to watch the next soccer match coming up on TV, and tells Maria he'll meet her at home. So, some minutes later, he decides he's had enough of watching soccer matches, and walks home. But when he gets there, he finds Maria unconcious, on her knees next to the bathtub, with her head inside the water, full of blood, clothes and shoe wear still on. He said in later declarations that he took her out of the water, and dragged her body out into their room. He had started doing CPR, when Maria's masseuse arrived, who then started helping him by calling close relatives first, and then, calling an ambulance. The masseuse says she touched Maria's head, and felt a hole in her skull bones.Two different ambulance service arrived, and declared Maria dead due to head trauma after an accidental fall, yet, one of the paramedics asks his headquarters to send a patrol, which is stalled by the family (according to the Netflix documentary, and since they were one of Buenos Aires's most influential families, they said they did not want police involved because they had already been involved in a scandal due to the Garcia-Belsunce's parents divorce 40 years before, and because according to the paramedics, the death was caused by an accident, not foul play). In the meantime, the family is instructed to wash the blood on the body and from the floor, and place her in a bed awaiting for the funeral hearse to take her for preparation. Since the doctors rejected filling the death certificate form, some friends sought help from the funeral home, who produced said certificate. She's buried the next day in Buenos Aires. No autopsy was done then. \n",
            "\n",
            "But then, one of Maria's brother finds what he thinks is metal from the bathroom furniture on the floor, and flushes it down the toilet. When he tells this to another brother (who is a well-known media attorney in Argentina) 45 days later, the latter asks for permission to have Maria's body exhumed and examined by means of an autopsy. During it, the coroner finds the hole in her skull, but inside of it, he finds five 32-caliber bullets. They also discover that the death certificate listed her death as caused by \"non-traumatic cardio-respiratory arrest\". They decide to search for the metal discovered in the bathroom in the nearby cesspool, and they find it, and after examination, ballistics conclude it's another 32-caliber bullet. The death ruling is changed to homicide, and suspicion befalls on Maria's family, due to the original phony death certificate and their insistence on not \"having the police involved\". Yet, after a Luminol test done in the house that found traces of blood that belonged to Maria and 2 unknown males (not related to the family or husband in any way), the D.A. pointed his fingers to the family, whom all of them had credible alibis. A troublesome neighbor who had conflicts with Maria in the past, was initially also investigated, but was not followed through (even though his alibi was proven to be weak). After a lengthy trial, Maria's husband and her brothers and sister served time in jail, but were later acquitted and released. \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Who would want to kill Maria Marta? It has been said that due to her work investigating missing children with probable links to human trafficking, she was murdered. Others say it was a robbery gone wrong. Unfounded rumours linked the family to Mexico's Juarez drug cartel, but no such link has ever been proven true. What do you guys think? \n",
            "\n",
            "Edit: the suggested timeline states that Maria Marta left on her bike right after the end of the Boca-River soccer match, at 18:07, and arrived at 18:12 at her house. The husband stayed at Maria's half-sister house to watch the following match (can't remember the teams' names), and left at 19:00. He's caught by the club house's CCTV cameras walking home after this hour. The murder is supposed to have taken place between 18:12 and 18:30 (when the masseuse arrived at the front gate of the compound and the security was desperately trying to reach Maria, to no avail). \n",

            " \n",
            "Everyone's heard the famous story of Paul Revere and his midnight ride. However heroic his actions may have been, however, they're not as remarkable as those of Sybil Ludington. She was the daughter of Colonel Henry Ludington, a leader of the Patriots in the early years of the American Revolution, who commanded a 400-man militia in Dutchess County, New York. On the evening of April 16, 1777, a messenger arrived at his farm with the news that British soldiers were ransacking the town of Danbury, just over the line in Connecticut. Col. Ludington had to assemble his militiamen for a counterattack, unfortunately all of them had returned to their farms in the area for the start of spring planting. How to get the word out to them?\n",
            "\n",
            "Enter his 16-year-old daughter Sybil. Hopping aboard her horse Star, she spent the entire night - in the pouring rain and through areas known to harbor bandits - racing around 40 miles to the militamens' farms and alerting them to the situation. Whenever Star began slowing down Sybil whacked the horse with a stick to keep it running. At one point a man offered to accompany her for her safety, but Sybil declined his offer. At another point during the ride Sybil pointed her musket at a thief and scared him off. All in all Sybil summoned anywhere from 200 to 400 of her father's militiamen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not only was Sybil's ride longer than Paul Revere's, and conducted in the rain, but she also managed to avoid capture. While the summoned militiamen arrived too late to save Danbury from ransacking, within a short time thereafter they confronted the British and drove them out of the area. Sybil's heroic ride earned her widespread acclaim and even a congratulatory message from George Washington. New York State erected historical markers along the route of her ride in the 1930's and a statue in 1961.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's an inspiring story of heroism ... assuming, that is, it was true. There were no contemporaneous reports of Sybil's ride. Even the letter from George Washington, obviously something she would have treasured, disappeared without a trace if it ever existed. The first mention of her ride was in a book of New York history by Martha Lamb, written in 1880, decades after Sybil's death. Lamb said she based her account on correspondence and interviews with family members, but she was not more specific and provided no copies of any documentation. In 1907 two of Sybil's grandchildren published a biography of Colonel Ludington in which there was a very brief reference to Sybil's ride, just two pages out of a 300-page book. No other references or documentation has ever been found.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sybil's story is clearly inspiring, a case of a plucky young lady performing an act of heroism, and also highlights the often-neglected role of women in early American history. It's the story that many people *want* to be true, but whether it actually was true remains a mystery.\n",

After these financial issues becoming more and more exacerbated the contest was abruptly pulled as Atari came under the new ownership of Jack Tramiel (This man is very interesting and I would recommend looking into his history) and Tramel Technologies. Due to this those who had progressed in the Waterworld contest were told they were no longer eligible and were given 2000 in compensation.\n",

            "And so the Crown of Life was to be left unclaimed. While work began on both the comic book and the game for Airworld – nothing came to fruition and so the Philosophers stone too was never to be won. Steven Bell and Michael Rideout, who were meant to compete for the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery, were given 15’000USD and an Atari 7800 as compensation for being unable to compete. So the sword of ultimate sorcery too would never be claimed by a competitor.\n",

            "Secret playoff for the crown as proposed by Gaming historian Curt Vendal (Notes on Curt at End). The Basis for this belief was that the game had been sold, players had submitted correct answers and thus Atari by law had to conduct the final portion of the competition. However the claim that legally Atari had to hold the contest doesn’t ring true, as it was an overarching tournament to win the Sword of ultimate sorcery which would require the fourth game to be released. Instead winners would be given compensation based on how far they had progressed such as the Waterworld contestants receiving 2000 each with Steven and Michael who progressed further receiving 15k each.\n",

            "Franklin mint had simply melted down the prizes. This belief stems from the concept that due to the ownership structure of the competition it was Franklin Mint who retained ownership over the prizes – yet these claims cannot be fully confirmed. Franklin mint themselves have stated they cannot speak on the issue as no one in the company from that time period is still around and there is no record of such event happening.\n",
            "\n",
            "The final Theory is that the remaining prizes are in the ownership of the Tramiel family, this theory is backed by game designer Tod Frye who played a pivotal role in Swordquest. Stating that the prizes – as far as he knew – were a part of Atari's assets and were transferred to the Trameil family in 1984. This claim is further backed up as another Atari employee reportedly spotted the sword in the Trameil family home above the mantel piece – yet as with all theories this is in disrepute as the Tramiel family claimed to not currently have possession of the prizes but also seemingly didn’t deny ever owning them. This seems to be the prevailing theory based on popularity in online spheres which dedicate themselves to solving the mystery but detractors often say it is just too poetic and wishful thinking…\n",

Steven Bell had reportedly unfortunately smelted down the Talisman of Penultimate Truth for money; using this cash for university fees – but he didn’t smelt down all of it. He kept the sword – the small white gold sword on the front of the Talisman. While I don’t know his financial positions from the time – I do consider the smelting of the Talisman to be a great loss for gaming. However in good news Michael Rideout has kept his Chalice of Light all these years in perfect condition, being safely stored in a bank lockbox. He also massively contributes to the accurate recording of the history surrounding the missing treasures of Swordquest and to that we must commend him.\n",

Daniel said Bianca left their San Antonio home on foot shortly thereafter, leaving their older two children behind. He said that he last saw her walking down the street alone as he drove past her in his truck. Despite Daniels claims there are differing stories as to whether Bianca left on foot, or if it was her husband who left, taking their youngest child, heading several hours north to Odessa where he works.

            "\n",
            "Floyd Otis Turner, age 40, was found dead, slumped over in the passenger seat of his car on July 10, 1984. His car was found in Sullivan County, Tennessee, right off Highway 126 and underneath the Interstate 81. His death was caused by a single gunshot above his right ear. Police believe that the driver's side window was shattered due to the bullet exiting his head.\n",
            "\n",
            "Floyd Otis Turner was described as a true Christian and family man. He was married with two children. It's important to note that his wife was apparently out of town at the time of murder. He worked for Eastman Chemical Company, and sold insurance at a side job. According to both his brother (Don Turner) and a pool salesman from West Virginia (the last known person to see Floyd Turner alive), Floyd had plans to meet with a new client on July 9th to discuss a possible insurance sell, one that apparently would be very good for him if he got the deal. Police noted that Floyd Turner wore casual clothes to the meeting with the pool saleman, but when found dead, was wearing a shirt and tie.\n",
            "\n",
            "Due to powder burns and a steel imprint on his right hand, police believed early on in the investigation that it was a suicide. Turner kept a gun locked in the glove compartment of his car, and that glove compartment was found to be unlocked with a gun missing. However, no weapon was found in or near the car. In fact, a fisherman discovered the gun in a lake miles away from the crime scene. Investigators have deemed it impossible to be a suicide. What's even more strange, is that the Turner family home burnt down only months after Floyd's death. No one was injured or died, but investigators were unable to determined what caused the fire.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2011, police announced that there were people they were interested in talking to, but were hesitant to call them a person of interest. Due to advances in science, they sent evidence out for DNA as well. I also found an article from 1999, where a Lt. Tim Smith claimed that he had been trying to build a case for over 15 years. According to Smith, \"There were at least two people who knew something. There were two suspects. They are still our suspects, but we can't tie them with it.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "On May 3rd, 2018, an article was posted about the murder with multiple small interviews with the brother and several investigators, including Major Joseph Stricker. Stricker said, \"this is an active case, a homicide never goes away.\" It was revealed in this article that evidence like a cigarette and a bottle were collected at the scene and have been retested over the the years for DNA samples. There are no official suspects in the case at this time, but investigators feel very strongly about a particular person. They are hoping that by reaching out to the public, maybe someone will come forward with more information. Despite the difficulty that comes with a case being this old, investigators are still looking for that \"key piece of evidence\" they need to make an arrest.\n",
